      "explanation": "Solution B is correct. In the case of a direct exchange rate, the domestic currency is the price currency (the numerator) and the foreign currency is the base currency (the denominator). If the domestic currency appreciates, then fewer units of the domestic currency are required to buy one unit of the foreign currency, and the exchange rate (domestic per foreign) declines. For example, if British pound sterling (GBP) appreciates against the euro (EUR), then euro–sterling (GBP/EUR) might decline.",

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect. In a fixed parity system the monetary authority has a discretionary target level of reserves, but in a CBS it does not because there is a commitment to exchange domestic currency for a specified foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate. Incorrect. It is the fixed-rate system that can use a basket of currencies for the peg. Correct. In a CBS, the monetary authority has an obligation to maintain 100% foreign currency reserves against the monetary base. It therefore cannot lend to troubled financial institutions. As long as the country under a fixed parity regime maintains its exchange peg, the central bank can serve as a lender of last resort.

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect. The appreciation of the euro against the US dollar can also be expressed as a depreciation of the US dollar against the euro.

The US dollar is expected to depreciate, not appreciate, against the euro by 3.38%. Correct. In the exchange rate quotation, USD/EUR, the US dollar is the price currency and the euro is the base currency. The USD/EUR is expected to increase from 1.3001 to 1.3456. This represents a 3.5% appreciation of the euro against the dollar, i.e., a percentage change of (1.3456/1.3001) – 1 = +3.50%. Incorrect. The USD/GBP is expected to decrease from 1.5805 to 1.5489. This represents a percentage change of (1.5489/1.5805) – 1 = –2.00%.
