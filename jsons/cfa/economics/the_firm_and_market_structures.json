Product differentiation is not possible under perfect competition. Correct because monopolistic competition is also highly competitive; however, it is considered a form of imperfect competition. The competitive characteristic is a notably large number of firms, while the monopoly aspect is the result of product differentiation.

Correct because a disadvantage of the concentration ratio is that it tends to be unaffected by mergers among the top market incumbents.

Just as with the perfectly competitive market structure, with relatively low entry costs, more firms will enter the market and lure some customers away from the firm making an economic profit. The loss of customers to new entrant firms will drive down the demand for all firms producing similar products. In the long run for the monopolistically competitive firm, economic profit will fall to zero. Incorrect. In monopolistic competition, there is no well-defined supply function. The information used to determine the appropriate level of output is based on the intersection of MC and MR. However, the price that will be charged is based on the market demand schedule. The firm’s supply curve should measure the quantity the firm is willing to supply at various prices. That information is not represented by either marginal cost or average cost. Correct. As the name implies, monopolistic competition is a hybrid market structure. The most distinctive factor in monopolistic competition is product differentiation. Although the market is made up of many firms that compose the product group, each producer attempts to distinguish its product from that of the others, and product differentiation is accomplished in a variety of ways.
