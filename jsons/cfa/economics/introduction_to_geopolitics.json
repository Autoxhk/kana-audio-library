      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because it is a cost of globalization, not a motivation. Through the process of greater economic and financial cooperation, companies may become dependent on other countries’ resources for their supply chains. Correct because non-state actors, such as companies and investors, who choose to participate in globalization consider three potential gains, including: intrinsic gain. One example of intrinsic gain is the personal growth or education that individuals may receive from expanding their horizons, experiencing new places, or learning new ideas. Incorrect because it is a cost of globalization, not a motivation. If a company moves a factory to another country, it creates jobs in the new country but reduces them at home, while firms in the new country may have to compete with the foreign firm for labor. Some actors will benefit from this exchange, but others may suffer. Introduction to Geopolitics describe geopolitics and its relationship with globalization",

On aggregate, this can result in the nation itself becoming dependent on other nations for certain resources (such as rare earth metals, cobalt, or copper). If there is a disruption to the supply chain, including via a moment of political non-cooperation, then firms may not be able to produce the good themselves. A is incorrect because the narrowing of pay differences between countries results from a motivation to pursue globalization, which is related to one of its advantages. It is an important way for companies to increase profitability by reducing their costs. Although wage differentials remain, they are decreasing. B is incorrect because the proportion of flows between developed economies as a share of overall trade continuing to decline as emerging market trade flows rise is a function of increased international investment.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for certain essential supply chains to be rebuilt domestically for emergency situations, with availability of critical spare parts being an analogy. The close integration of the US and Canadian economies through the revised USMCA agreement effectively makes expanded production at an existing Canadian factory an example of reducing manufacturing risk by relocating to home countries via reshoring. B is incorrect because instead of reducing manufacturing risk by duplicating or fortifying its supply chain, the company is simply continuing to use its existing capacity more intensively. C is incorrect because although the production is intended to better supply its home market, there is no evidence that the company is expanding its presence in the US market or shifting its focus to the exclusion of available opportunities elsewhere.",

Many countries—including those with multilateral trade agreements—impose restrictions on cabotage across transportation subsectors, meaning that shippers, airlines, and truck drivers are not allowed to transport goods and services within another country’s borders. Allowing cabotage requires coordination on areas like physical security and economic coordination, a highly multilateral (multifaceted tool) process. B is incorrect because armed conflict is the most extreme example of a national security tool. It can be either internal or external to a country in taking a direct and active approach to wielding influence. C is incorrect because nationalization of key export industries is an economic tool. This process of transferring an activity or industry from private to state control is a non-cooperative approach to asserting economic control.",

A is incorrect because exogenous risk is sudden and unanticipated. Examples include sudden uprisings, invasions, or the aftermath of natural disasters. The timing and range of its effects thus have the greatest unknowns. C is incorrect because thematic risks are known risks that evolve and expand over a period of time.

      "solution_html": "<div><h4>Solution</h4>\n<p><strong>B is correct.</strong> <em>Event risk</em> evolves around set dates, such as elections or new legislation, or other date-driven milestones, such as holidays or political anniversaries. Analysts can thus look to political calendars as a predictable starting point for determining the occurrence of event risk, with time to devise a suitable response.</p>\n<p>A is incorrect because exogenous risk is sudden and unanticipated. Examples include sudden uprisings, invasions, or the aftermath of natural disasters. The timing and range of its effects thus have the greatest unknowns. C is incorrect because thematic risks are known risks that evolve and expand over a period of time. Climate change, pattern migration, the rise of populist forces, and the ongoing threat of terrorism fall into this category. These are more foreseeable than exogenous risks, but with their extended interval of exposure, planned responses likely require continual adjustments.</p></div>",
