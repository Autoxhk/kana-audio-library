      "explanation": "Solution Correct because there may be occasions where the demand for money becomes infinitely elastic so that further injections of money into the economy will not serve to further lower interest rates or affect real activity. This is known as a liquidity trap. In this extreme circumstance, monetary policy can become completely ineffective. Incorrect because crowding out is the reduction in private sector investment due to increased government borrowing and describes a difficulty in implementing fiscal, not monetary, policy. Incorrect because this is the action lag and describes a difficulty in implementing fiscal policy. An example of the action lag is the government's decision to raise spending on capital projects to increase employment and incomes, but they may take many months to implement. Monetary Policy describe qualities of effective central banks; contrast their use of inflation, interest rate, and exchange rate targeting in expansionary or contractionary monetary policy; and describe the limitations of monetary policy",

For the sake of simplicity, we explore short-term or 'high velocity' impacts, medium-term, and long-term or 'low velocity' impacts [...]. In the short term, we may see volatility in the markets affecting entire industries or even the entire market. Exogenous or 'black swan' events tend to fit into this category, causing market volatility and investor flight to quality. A black swan risk is an event that is rare and difficult to predict but has an important impact. Investors with the appropriate time horizon and risk tolerance may make tactical changes to their investment choices as a result of these events. Long-term changes are unlikely to be necessary. Incorrect because this relates to a medium-term impact of geopolitical risk instead: Risks with a medium-term impact may begin to impair companies’ processes, costs, and investment opportunities, resulting in lower valuations. These risks tend to be distributed towards specific sectors, meaning they will impact some companies much more than others. Incorrect because this relates to a low velocity impact of geopolitical risk instead: The velocity of geopolitical risk is the pace at which it impacts an investor portfolio. For the sake of simplicity, we explore short-term or 'high velocity' impacts, medium-term, and long-term or 'low velocity' impacts. And long-term risks may have important environmental, social, governance, and other impacts. This can impact an investor’s asset allocation—including choice of asset classes and investment styles—for a long-term horizon; however, the immediate impact on portfolios is likely to be more limited.

Specifically, there are four archetypes of country behavior: autarky, hegemony, multilateralism, and bilateralism, where hegemony is situated low on the cooperation spectrum and high on the globalization spectrum. Hegemonic countries tend to be regional or even global leaders, and they use their political or economic influence of others to control resources.

This acts as a fiscal stimulus and serves to reduce the size of the multiplier, dampening the output response of whatever caused the fall in output in the first place.
