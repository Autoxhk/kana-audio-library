      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect. Although the ratio of consumer installment debt to income is a lagging indicator, it is more directly indicating that an upturn has been underway, not that the expansion is over because consumers only borrow heavily when they are confident in the economy. Correct. The ratio of consumer installment debt to income is a lagging indicator. An increase in it, by itself, would be evidence that an upturn is already underway. This would confirm the implication of positive changes in coincident indicators that an expansion is in place. Incorrect. Leading indicators indicate what is coming, but the ratio of consumer installment debt to income is a lagging indicator. The reason it is a lagging indicator is because consumers only borrow heavily when they are confident in the economy. Understanding Business Cycles describe how resource use, consumer and business activity, housing sector activity, and external trade sector activity vary over the business cycle and describe their measurement using economic indicators",
