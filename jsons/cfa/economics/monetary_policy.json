We have higher output and higher interest rates, and government spending will be a larger proportion of overall national income. Incorrect because, in the case of tight monetary policy and tight fiscal policy, interest rates rise (at least if the monetary impact on interest rates is larger) and reduce private demand.

      "choices": {},
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect. Deflation is a pervasive and persistent fall in a general price index and is more difficult for conventional monetary policy to deal with than inflation. This is because once the monetary authority has cut nominal interest rates to zero to stimulate the economy, it cannot cut them any further. It is at this point that the economic conditions for a liquidity trap arise. Deflation raises the real value of debt, while the persistent fall in prices can encourage consumers to put off current consumption, leading to a fall in demand that leads to further deflationary pressure. Thus a deflationary “trap” can develop, which is characterized by weak consumption growth, falling prices, and increases in real debt levels. Correct. Quantitative easing (QE) is an “unconventional” approach to monetary policy and is operationally similar to open market purchase operations but conducted on a much larger scale. The additional reserves created by central banks in a policy of quantitative easing can be used to buy any assets. The idea is that this additional reserve will kick-start lending, causing broad money growth to expand, which will eventually lead to an increase in real economic activity. Incorrect. A liquidity trap is associated with occasions where the demand for money becomes infinitely elastic—that is, where the demand curve is horizontal and individuals are willing to hold additional money balances without any change in the interest rate—so that further injections of money into the economy will not serve to further lower interest rates or affect real activity. In this extreme circumstance, monetary policy can become completely ineffective. Monetary Policy describe qualities of effective central banks; contrast their use of inflation, interest rate, and exchange rate targeting in expansionary or contractionary monetary policy; and describe the limitations of monetary policy",

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect. If the central bank increases required reserve ratios, the banks will decrease lending and the money supply will decline. Incorrect. The higher the policy rate, the higher the potential penalty that banks will have to pay to the central bank if they run short of liquidity, the greater will be their willingness to reduce lending, and the more likely the money supply will decrease. Correct. When a central bank purchases securities, bank reserves increase. The banks therefore have excess reserves and are able to increase their lending, increasing the money supply.

      "explanation": "Solution Correct. The monetary transmission mechanism is the process whereby a central bank’s interest rate gets transmitted through the economy and ultimately affects the rate of increase of prices (inflation). Incorrect because, although policy rate actions do transmit through the economy by affecting total demand, this influence on total demand is an intermediate effect that drives subsequent domestic inflationary pressure. In effect, policy rate actions ultimately impact inflation through the avenue of total demand. Incorrect because although policy rate actions do transmit through the economy through the channel of market rates (both short-term and long-term interest rates), this is just one of four channels and multiple interconnected channel relationships that impacts total demand. In effect, policy rate actions ultimately impact inflation through the channel of market interest rates (including long-term interest rates).
