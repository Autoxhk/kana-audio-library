      "choices": {
        "A": "based on independent third-party reports.",
        "B": "based on individual discrete items, not aggregations.",
        "C": "disclosed regularly or based on items that are disclosed regularly."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Solution C is correct. Forecast objects should either be disclosed regularly or be directly calculable using what is disclosed regularly. Information that is not disclosed regularly (such as a third-party consultancy’s report) is suitable to inform forecasts but can be problematic for direct use, because forecasts cannot be confirmed in a timely manner. While it may be intuitive to forecast individual discrete items, such as sales and gross margin by individual product line, if gross margin is disclosed only on a consolidated basis, it will be difficult for analysts to verify their product-line gross margin estimates.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Solution A is correct. Management has an advantage at the firm level and tends to make more accurate forecasts for objects that are subject to management actions, such as capital expenditures. Management does not have an informational advantage over investors in forecasting macroeconomic variables, such as GDP, the business cycle, or the prices of commodities. Hutton et al. (2012) found that investors have an informational advantage over management at the macroeconomic level.",

      "question": "<div><div><div>\n<p>An analyst forecasts a company’s sales using a historical results approach and top-down drivers (expected industry sales and expected market share). The analyst observes that the forecast is within the range of management guidance on sales but is toward the upper end and not closer to the midpoint. Which of the following is the <em>most likely</em> explanation for this observation?</p>\n</div></div></div>",
      "choices": {
        "A": "The analyst has been overly optimistic in estimating the company’s expected market share.",
        "B": "Management’s true expectations are toward the upper end, but management has created a range using a pessimistic lower bound that is more easily cleared.",
        "C": "The midpoint represents management’s true expectations, and management has a lower and better estimate of market growth based on macroeconomic variables."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Solution B is correct. Management has a tendency to pad its guidance to make it easier to achieve the forecast results for which management will be rewarded. Management does not have an informational advantage at the macroeconomic level.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Solution A is correct. Historical results is least appropriate, because the company has changed its competitive strategy. Analyst’s discretionary forecast may be appropriate, because the company is undergoing a fundamental change. The company is growing and may be transitioning to be more like the industry, in which case historical base rates and convergence may be an appropriate approach.",
