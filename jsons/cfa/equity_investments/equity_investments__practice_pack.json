      "explanation": "Solution Correct because behavioral finance allows for the possibility that the dislike for risk is not symmetrical, in contrast to the more general models where researchers assume that investors do not like risk (risk aversion), whether the risk is that returns are higher than expected or lower than expected. Incorrect because behavioral finance research supports the phenomenon that investors are loss averse. Behavioral finance allows for the possibility that the dissatisfaction resulting from a loss exceeds the satisfaction resulting from a gain of the same magnitude. Some argue that behavioral theories of loss aversion can explain observed overreaction in markets. Incorrect because behavioral finance research supports the phenomenon that investors are overconfident. Evidence has suggested that overconfidence results in mispricing for US, UK, German, French, and Japanese markets. Market Efficiency describe behavioral finance and its potential relevance to understanding market anomalies",

Because buyers of a company's shares on the ex-dividend date are no longer eligible to receive the upcoming dividend, all else being equal, on that day the company's share price immediately decreases by the amount of the foregone dividend. If the share trades at $29.00 on 19 August (the day before ex-date) and the upcoming dividend is $0.50, then all else being equal, the shares would trade at $28.50 ($29.00 - $0.50) on the ex-date. Incorrect because $29.00 is the price of the share before the ex-date which is the last day purchasers will receive the upcoming dividend. All else being equal, the share price should trade below $29.00 and not at or above $29.00. Incorrect because purchasers of shares on the ex-date or after the ex-date will not be entitled to the upcoming dividend and the share price should trade below $29.00 and not above $29.00. An uninformed candidate may confuse the dates and think that the share price on the ex-date should include dividends declared and inadvertently think that the 19 August share price doesn't include the dividend.

Investors are capable of avoiding nonsystematic risk through diversification by forming a portfolio of assets that are not highly correlated with one another. Security market indices are usually broad and well diversified. They do serve as market proxies when measuring risk-adjusted performance. The beta of an actively managed portfolio allows investors to form a passive alternative with the same level of systematic risk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Correct</strong> because indices play a critical role as proxies for asset classes in asset allocation models.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Incorrect because asset-based valuation is a method for valuing individual companies, so a broad security market indices is not a useful proxy. Asset-based valuation of a company uses estimates of the market or fair value of the company's assets and liabilities. Asset-based valuation models are frequently used together with multiplier models to value private companies. As public companies increase reporting or disclosure of fair values, asset-based valuation may be increasingly used to supplement present value and multiplier models of valuation.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Security Market Indexes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>describe uses of security market indexes</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

Non-callable shares do not expose the investor to the greatest potential risk. Also, dividends on cumulative preference shares accrue so that if the company decides not to pay a dividend in one or more periods, the unpaid dividends accrue. This feature provides the investor with a certainty of future cash flows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Correct</strong> because a callable preference share with non-cumulative dividends has greater uncertainty of cash flows than a putable preference share with non-cumulative dividends. From an investor's point of view, putable common or preference shares are less risky than their callable or non-callable counterparts. The callable preference share with non-cumulative dividends has greater uncertainty of cash flows than the non-callable preference share with cumulative dividends on the basis of both its callable feature, as previously described, and its non-cumulative feature. Cumulative preference shares have lower risk than non-cumulative preference shares.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Overview of Equity Securities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>compare the risk and return characteristics of different types of equity securities</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
