      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because restrictions on short selling limit arbitrage trading, which impedes market efficiency. Correct because transaction costs are incurred in trading to exploit any perceived market inefficiency. If there are limits on transaction costs, more investors would be encouraged to trade. This brings about increased number of market participants which in turn contributes to market efficiency. One of the most critical factors contributing to the degree of efficiency in a market is the number of market participants. Incorrect because a lack of trading activity can cause or accentuate other market imperfections that impede market efficiency. In fact, in many of these markets, such as China, trading in many of the listed stocks is restricted for foreigners. By nature, this limitation reduces the number of market participants, restricts the potential for trading activity, and hence reduces market efficiency.

Finding significant abnormal returns does not necessarily indicate that markets are inefficient or that abnormal returns can be realized by applying the strategy to future time periods. Abnormal returns are considered market anomalies because they may be the result of the model used to estimate the expected returns or may be the result of underestimating transaction costs or other expenses associated with implementing the strategy, rather than because of market inefficiency.",
