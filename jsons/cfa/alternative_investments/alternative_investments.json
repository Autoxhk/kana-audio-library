Investors may be required to keep their money in the hedge fund for a minimum period (referred to as a lockup period) before they are allowed to make withdrawals or redeem shares.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Correct because the hurdle rate is a <i>minimum </i>rate of return, typically 8%, that the GP must exceed in order to earn the performance fee. GPs typically receive 20% of the total profit of the private equity fund net of any <i>hard hurdle rate</i>, in which case the GP earns fees on annual returns in excess of the hurdle rate, or net of the <i>soft hurdle rate</i>, in which case the fee is calculated on the entire annual gross return as long as the set hurdle is exceeded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Incorrect because in hedge funds, fee calculations also take into account a high-water mark, which reflects the highest value used to calculate an incentive fee. A high-water mark is the <i>highest </i>value of the fund investment ever achieved at a performance fee crystallization date, net of fees, by the individual LP. A high-water mark clause states that a hedge fund manager must recuperate declines in value from the high-water mark before performance fees can be charged on newly generated profits. The use of high-water marks protects clients from paying twice for the same performance.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Alternative Investment Features, Methods, and Structures</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>describe investment ownership and compensation structures commonly used in alternative investments</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

In activist strategies, hedge fund managers secure sufficient equity holdings to allow them to influence a company’s policies or direction. The hedge fund manager thus tries to create his or her own catalyst, influencing the investment’s ultimate destiny by creating a desired corporate outcome. Incorrect because equity hedge strategies, which include market neutral, are focused on public equity markets and take long and short positions in equity and equity derivative securities. Market neutral strategies use quantitative (technical) and fundamental analysis to identify under- and overvalued equity securities. The hedge fund takes long positions in securities it has identified as undervalued and short positions in securities it has identified as overvalued. The hedge fund tries to maintain a net position that is neutral with respect to market risk and other risk factors (size, industry, momentum, value, etc.). Ideally, the portfolio has an overall beta of approximately zero. Incorrect because merger arbitrage strategies involve going long (buying) the stock of the company being acquired at a discount to its announced takeover price and going short (selling) the stock of the acquiring company when the merger or acquisition is announced. The manager may expect to profit once the initial deal spread narrows to the closing value of the transaction after it is fully consummated.

      "explanation": "Solution Correct because decentralized exchanges lack a centralized control mechanism and operate on a distributed platform without central coordination or control. This comes with the benefit that should one of the computers on the network be attacked, the exchange remains operational since there are numerous other computers that continue to operate on the network. That is why attacking decentralized exchanges is substantially more difficult, rendering such attacks almost certain to fail. However, for a centralized exchange, trading is hosted on private servers, exposing the centralized exchanges and their clients to security vulnerabilities. Should the exchange's servers become compromised, the entire system may become paralyzed, halting trade, and leaking vital user information. Hence, decentralized exchanges are less susceptible to attacks from hackers. Moreover, decentralized exchanges are difficult to regulate because no single individual, organization, or group controls the system. This means that those trading on decentralized exchanges are generally free to transact without any regulatory scrutiny. However, some centralized exchanges are regulated, and depending on jurisdiction, these exchanges may be regulated as financial exchanges or other types of financial intermediaries.

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because the performance fee is not calculated net of the management fee: Management fee = $100 million × 120% × 1% = $1.200 million. Performance fee = [($100 million × 20%) – ($100 million × 3%)] × 15% = $2.550 million. Total fee = $1.200 million + $2.550 million = $3.750 million. Investor return = ($20 – $3.750) / $100 = 16.250% ≈ 16.3%. Correct because the hurdle rate is a minimum rate of return, typically 8%, that the GP must exceed in order to earn the performance fee. GPs typically receive 20% of the total profit of the private equity fund net of any hard hurdle rate , in which case the GP earns fees on annual returns in excess of the hurdle rate, or net of the soft hurdle rate , in which case the fee is calculated on the entire annual gross return as long as the set hurdle is exceeded. Management fee = $100 million × 120% × 1% = $1.200 million. Performance fee = [($100 million × 20%) – ($100 million × 3%) − $1.200 million)] × 15% = $2.370 million.

Incorrect because the current high-water mark is used as a cap for management fee and incentive fee (instead of the threshold representing the highest cumulative return above which an incentive fee is calculated). Accordingly, Management fee = Management fee based on end-of-year AUM × Current high-water mark = 2% × $320,000,000 = $6,400,000.

Correct because in hedge funds, fee calculations also take into account a high-water mark, which reﬂects the highest value used to calculate an incentive fee. A high-water mark is the highest value of the fund investment ever achieved at a performance fee crystallization date, net of fees, by the individual LP. A high-water mark clause states that a hedge fund manager must recuperate declines in value from the high-water mark before performance fees can be charged on newly generated profits.

Although the gross return of Rotunda results in a $360 million gross NAV, the deduction of the $7.2 million management fee brings NAV to $352.8 million, which is below the prior high-water mark. Rotunda earns a management fee of $7.20 million but does not earn an incentive fee because the year-end fund value net of management fee does not exceed the prior high-water mark of $357 million. Since Rotunda is still also below the prior-year high-water mark, the hurdle rate of return is also basically irrelevant in this fee calculation. The specifics of this calculation are as follows: End-of-year AUM = Prior year-end AUM × (1 + Fund return) = $288 million × 1.25 = $360 million. $360 million × 2% = $7.20 million management fee. $360 million − $7.2 million = $352.8 million AUM net of management fee.

Since Rotunda is still also below the prior-year high-water mark, the hurdle rate of return is also basically irrelevant in this fee calculation.</p>\n<p>The specifics of this calculation are as follows:</p>\n<ul class=\"cfa-simple\" id=\"CFA2456-R-s03-L5\">\n<li>\n<p>End-of-year AUM = Prior year-end AUM × (1 + Fund return) = $288 million × 1.25 = $360 million.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$360 million × 2% = $7.20 million management fee.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$360 million − $7.2 million = $352.8 million AUM net of management fee.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The year-end AUM net of fees do not exceed the $357 million high-water mark.

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because private equity includes a substantive initial capital commitment promise, followed by high initial fee drag (calculated on total committed capital, not the capital actually called), followed by the identification of longer-term growth or turnaround opportunities, and an eventual positive expected return when the staggered returns of the fund are realized. Correct because private equity investments generally involve an initial capital commitment, but actual capital flows often lag that commitment because capital 'calls' are staggered over substantive periods of time. Private equity returns are frequently described in terms of the J-curve effect.

2, and 4 all meet the criterion and the profit is split 80/20 between the LPs and GP. Investment 3 does not earn the GP any carry because it fails to meet the preferred return; neither does Investment 5, whose profit is negative. Because of the clawback clause, the GP’s carry is reduced by $2 million (or 20% of the loss on Investment 5). Therefore, the total carried interest adds up to $30 million, or 30/160 = 18.75% of the total profit made by the fund.</p></div>",

      "explanation": "Solution Correct because the partnership agreement usually specifies that the performance fee is earned only after the fund achieves a return known as a hurdle rate. The hurdle rate is a minimum rate of return, typically 8%, that the GP must exceed in order to earn the performance fee. GPs typically receive 20% of the total profit of the private equity fund net of any hard hurdle rate , in which case the GP earns fees on annual returns in excess of the hurdle rate, or net of the soft hurdle rate , in which case the fee is calculated on the entire annual gross return as long as the set hurdle is exceeded. AUM at year-end = €200 million × 115% = €230 million. Management fee = €230 million × 1.5% = €3.45 million. The incentive fee is calculated net of management fees and there is also a hard hurdle rate. Accordingly, Incentive fee = (€230 million – €200 million – €3.45 million – €10 million) × 20% = €16.55 million × 20% = €3.31 million; where hard hurdle = €200 million × 5% = €10 million. Thus, total fees = €3.45 million + €3.31 million = €6.76 million ≈ €6.8 million. Incorrect because it calculates incentive fees gross of management fees. That is: AUM at year-end = €200 million × 115% = €230 million. Management fee = €230 million × 1.5% = €3.45 million. Incentive fee = (€230 million – €200 million – €10 million) × 20% = €20 million × 20% = €4.00 million; where hard hurdle = €200 million × 5% = €10 million. Thus, total fees = €3.45 million + €4.00 million = €7.45 million ≈ €7.5 million. Incorrect because it excludes the hard hurdle rate in the calculation of incentive fees. That is: AUM at year-end = €200 million × 115% = €230 million. Management fee = €230 million × 1.5% = €3.45 million.

The hurdle rate is a minimum rate of return, typically 8%, that the GP must exceed in order to earn the performance fee. GPs typically receive 20% of the total profit of the private equity fund net of any hard hurdle rat e, in which case the GP earns fees on annual returns in excess of the hurdle rate, or net of the soft hurdle rate , in which case the fee is calculated on the entire annual gross return as long as the set hurdle is exceeded. Hard hurdle = $500 million × 10% = $50 million. Incentive fee (based on returns net of management fees) = ($610 million – $500 million – $50 million – $12.2 million) × 15% = $47.8 million × 15% = $7.17 million ≈ $7.2 million.

Incorrect because it assumes a soft hurdle rate (instead of a hard hurdle rate) of 10%. End-of-year AUM = $500 million × 22% = $610 million. Management fee = $610 million × 2% = $12.2 million. Gross annual return > soft hurdle rate, hence the hurdle rate is not deducted from the calculation of the incentive fee.

      "explanation": "Solution The correct answer is C. Unlike traditional financial assets, most digital assets do not have an inherent value based on underlying assets or the potential cash flow or earnings they are expected to generate. Digital asset transactions are usually kept on decentralized digital ledgers using cryptography and algorithms without any central intermediaries. Regulations around digital assets are also ambiguous and evolving, unlike most traditional financial assets, which are subject to a well-defined set of regulations.",

The benefit is that should one of the computers on the network be attacked, the exchange remains operational since there are numerous other computers that continue to operate on the network. For this reason, decentralized exchanges are substantially more difficult to hack, rendering such attacks almost certain to fail. However, transactions on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are hosted on private servers, exposing the centralized exchanges and their clients to security vulnerabilities.
