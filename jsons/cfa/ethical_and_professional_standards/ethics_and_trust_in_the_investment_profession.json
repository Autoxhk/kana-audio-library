These standards of conduct serve as benchmarks for the minimally acceptable behavior of community members. Codes of ethics serve as a general guide for how community members should act; they communicate the organization’s values and overall expectations regarding member behavior, but they do not identify specific behaviors required of community members. Laws and regulations are rules of conduct defined by governments and related entities about obligatory and forbidden conduct broadly applicable for individuals and entities under their jurisdiction.",

Incorrect. A short-term focus is an aspect of situation influences. Our brains more easily and quickly identify, recognize and consider short-term situational influences versus longer-term considerations. Long-term considerations have less immediate consequences making them less obvious as factors to consider in a decision and therefore, less likely to influence our overall decision making. Incorrect.

We more easily recognize and consider short-term situational influences than longer-term considerations because longer-term considerations have fewer immediate consequences than situational influences do. When decision making is too narrowly focused on short-term factors, we tend to ignore longer-term risks and consequences, and the likelihood of poor ethical decision making increases. A strong compliance policy is a good first step toward developing an ethical culture; a focus on rules adherence may not be sufficient. Emphasis on compliance may not encourage decision makers to consider the larger picture and can oversimplify decision making. Taken to the extreme, a strong compliance culture can become another situational influence that blinds employees to other important considerations. An overconfidence bias can place too much importance on internal traits and intrinsic motivations, such as “I’m honest and would not lie,” even though studies have shown that internal traits are generally not the main determinant of whether or not someone will behave ethically in a given situation.",
