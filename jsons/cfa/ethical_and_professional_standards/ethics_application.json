      "question": "<div><div><p>Ann Macharia, CFA, is an independent consultant hired by MK Investment (MKI) to review its proposal to manage a large pension fund. While reviewing a draft of the document, Macharia notices a large section of material has been added to the proposal by MKI's CIO. The additional material looks exactly like what Macharia wrote for a previous client, describing the client's proprietary investment process. Macharia is <em>most likely </em>required to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>remove the added material and report her suspicions to MKI.</li>\n<li>wait to say anything until the proposal is submitted to meet the conditions of her consulting contract.</li>\n<li>confirm her client uses the same thorough investment process as described in the added material, and make a few minor changes.</li>\n</ol>\n</div></div>",
      "choices": {},
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Solution Correct , because the identical material reflected in her previous client's proposal belongs to that client, even though she wrote it on their behalf as their consultant. To use it in its identical format would be considered plagiarism. In addition, the description also identifies a proprietary process and is therefore not applicable to her existing client's investment process. Consequently, to prevent violating Standard I(C) Misrepresentation the material should be removed. The Standard states Members and Candidates must not knowingly make any misrepresentations relating to investment analysis, recommendations, actions, or other professional activities. Standard I(C) Misrepresentation prohibits plagiarism in the preparation of material for distribution to employers, associates, clients, prospects, or the general public. Macharia should also report the use of plagiarized material to the client so they can take action to prevent the event being repeated in the future (Standard I(A) Knowledge of the Law). Allowing the use of plagiarized material reflects poorly on a firm and can hurt their reputation. By reporting to the client Macharia is also protecting the interests of her clients (Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care). Incorrect, Standard I(A) Knowledge of the Law states if a member has reasonable grounds to believe that ongoing activities within a firm are illegal or unethical, the member or candidate must dissociate, or separate, from the activity. In this case, Macharia is required to protect the interests of her clients (Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care) by helping them avoid plagiarism and misrepresenting their investment process (Standard I(C) Misrepresentation). To most effectively do this, the first step should be to attempt to stop the behavior by bringing it to the attention of the employer (or client in this case) through a supervisor or the firm's compliance department. Incorrect, because making a few changes here and there would be insufficient to avoid the statement from being considered plagiarized or misrepresenting the firm's investment process by using a description of the previous client's proprietary investment process. Macharia has a duty to take the necessary action to prevent this unethical behavior. To do otherwise would cause her to violate Standard I(A) Knowledge of the Law and Standard I(C) Misrepresentation. Standard I(A) Knowledge of the Law states if a member has reasonable grounds to believe that ongoing activities within a firm are illegal or unethical, the member or candidate must dissociate, or separate, from the activity. When direct discussions with the person committing the violation are unsuccessful, the first step should be to attempt to stop the behavior by bringing it to the attention of the employer through a supervisor or the firm's compliance department.

      "question": "<div><div><p>Stella Murphy, CFA, a portfolio manager, meets with a client who is concerned about a security recently added to the portfolio. Murphy reviews with the client the decision for buying the security and the risks associated with the company and stock. The following week, the company announces it is buying a company in a non-related industry and the stock falls sharply. The client accuses Murphy of not disclosing all the risks associated with holding the security. Murphy explains the company's acquisition was unexpected and not factored into the forecast. Has Murphy <em>most likely</em> violated the Standards?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No</li>\n<li>Yes, the Standard relating to communication with clients</li>\n<li>Yes, the Standard relating to diligence and reasonable basis</li>\n</ol>\n</div></div>",

      "explanation": "Solution Correct because Murphy has not violated any Standards. Standard V(B), Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients, requires members, use reasonable judgment in identifying which factors are important to their investment analyses, recommendations, or actions and include those factors in communications with clients and prospective client. Murphy has done this when she reviewed the investment rationale behind buying the security and the potential investment risks. The appropriateness of risk disclosure should be assessed on the basis of what was known at the time the investment action was taken (often called an ex ante basis). Members must disclose significant risks known to them at the time of the disclosure. Members cannot be expected to disclose risks they are unaware of at the time recommendations or investment actions are made. A one-time investment loss that occurs after the disclosure does not constitute a pertinent factor in assessing whether significant risks and limitations were properly disclosed. Murphy has also not violated Standard V(A), Diligence and Reasonable Basis, which requires members, have a reasonable and adequate basis, supported by appropriate research and investigation, for any investment analysis, recommendation, or action. Murphy has explained the investment thesis supporting the purchase of the security as well as the risk to the earnings stream. While having no knowledge of a risk or limitation that subsequently triggers a loss may reveal a deficiency in the diligence and reasonable basis of the research it is not a violation of the Standard.
