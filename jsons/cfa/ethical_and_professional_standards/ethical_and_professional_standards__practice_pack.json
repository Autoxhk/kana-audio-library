      "question": "<div><div><p>Lisa Hajak, CFA, specialized in research on real estate companies at Cornerstone Country Bank for the past twenty years. Hajak recently started her own investment research firm, Hajak Investment Advisory. One of her former clients at Cornerstone asks Hajak to update a research report she wrote on a real estate company when she was at Cornerstone. Hajak updates the report, which she had copied to her personal computer without the bank’s knowledge, and replaces references to the bank with her new firm, Hajak Investment Advisory. Hajak also incorporates the conclusions of a real estate study conducted by the Realtors Association that appeared in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. She references the Journal as her source in her report. She provides the revised report free of charge along with a cover letter for the bank’s client to become a client of her firm. Concerning the reissued research report, Hajak <em>least likely</em> violated the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct because she:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>solicited the bank’s client.</li>\n<li>did not obtain consent to use the bank report.</li>\n<li>did not cite the actual source of the real estate study.</li>\n</ol>\n</div></div>",

In all instances, a member or candidate must cite the actual source of the information. If she does not obtain the report and review the information, the manager runs the risk of relying on second‐hand information that may misstate facts. Best practice would be either to obtain the complete study from its original author and cite only that author or to use the information provided by the intermediary and cite both sources. Incorrect because according to Standard V(C)–Record Retention, when a member or candidate leaves a firm to seek other employment, the member or candidate cannot take the property of the firm, including originals or copies of supporting records of the member’s or candidate’s work, to the new employer without the express consent of the previous employer.

Further, if a client or former client expressly authorizes the member or candidate to disclose information, however, the member or candidate may follow the terms of the authorization and provide the information.

Have a reasonable and adequate basis, supported by appropriate research and investigation, for any investment analysis, recommendation, or action. Additionally, the results of research are not always clear, and different people may have different opinions based on the same factual evidence. In this case, the committee may have valid reasons for issuing a report that differs from the analyst’s original research. The firm can issue a report that is different from the original report of an analyst as long as there is a reasonable and adequate basis for its conclusions. Generally, analysts must write research reports that reflect their own opinion and can ask the firm not to put their name on reports that ultimately differ from that opinion. When the work is a group effort, however, not all members of the team may agree with all aspects of the report. Ultimately, members and candidates can ask to have their names removed from the report, but if they are satisfied that the process has produced results or conclusions that have a reasonable and adequate basis, members and candidates do not have to dissociate from the report even when they do not agree with its contents. Yong was thorough in her research and There is no evidence to assume that she did not have a reasonable and adequate basis for her recommendation. Additionally there is no violation of the standard relating to loyalty, prudence and care. Incorrect because according to Standard III (A), Loyalty, Prudence, and Care Members and Candidates have a duty of loyalty to their clients and must act with reasonable care and exercise prudent judgment.

Incorrect because software (and the vendors who supply software) cannot be “compliant.” Software can assist firms in achieving compliance with the GIPS standards (e.g., by calculating performance in a manner consistent with the calculation requirements of the Standards), but only a firm managing assets can claim compliance once the firm has satisfied all requirements of the standards.
