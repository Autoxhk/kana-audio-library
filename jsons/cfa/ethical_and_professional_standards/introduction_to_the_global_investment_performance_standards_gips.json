A is incorrect because including terminated portfolios is consistent with the GIPS standards. If the firm instead presented a performance history that excludes terminated portfolios, however, such a practice would be misleading and not allowed under the GIPS standards. C is incorrect because presenting performance for its mandate covering all periods since the firm’s inception is consistent with the GIPS standards.

Incorrect because complying with the GIPS standards is voluntary. Compliance with the GIPS standards is not typically required by legal or regulatory authorities.

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because according to the GIPS standards misleading practices include Representative Accounts: Selecting a top-performing portfolio to represent the firm’s overall investment results for a specific mandate. Therefore, the GIPS standards does not allow the use of a representative account to present the firm's overall investment results. Incorrect because presenting an 'average' performance history that excludes portfolios whose poor performance was weak enough to result in termination of the firm is known as survivorship bias and is a misleading practice when presenting investment performance data. Therefore, presenting performance history that only includes accounts remaining at the firm (and excludes accounts that has left the firm) is incorrect. Correct because the GIPS standards are a practitioner-driven set of ethical principles that establish a standardized, industry-wide approach for investment firms to follow in calculating and presenting their historical investment results to prospective clients. Therefore, the GIPS standard establish a standardized approach to presenting historical investment results to prospective clients, and this answer is correct.
