      "question": "<div><div><p>A central bank fines a commercial bank it supervises for not following statutory regulations regarding non-performing loan provisions on three large loans as a result of the bank’s loan provisioning policy. Louis Marie Buffet, CFA, sits on the Board of Directors of the commercial bank as a non-executive director, representing minority shareholders. He also chairs the internal audit committee of the bank that determines the loan provisioning policy of the bank. Mercy Gatabaki, CFA, is the bank’s external auditor and follows international auditing standards whereby she tests the loan portfolio by randomly selecting loans to check for compliance in all aspects of central bank regulations.

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because only Buffet is most likely to have violated Standard I–Professionalism by not following central bank regulations. Correct because Buffet sat on the audit committee that determined the bank’s provisioning policies that were contrary to the statutory regulations of the central bank. As a result, he most likely violated Standard I–Professionalism by not abiding with regulations of a regulatory body. Gatabaki did not violate Standard I–Professionalism as it is not apparent she knowingly facilitated the incorrect provisioning policy, Incorrect because Gatabaki most likely did not violate Standard I–Professionalism as it is not apparent she knowingly facilitated the incorrect provisioning policy or followed it. Gatabaki randomly selects loans for her audit and given the relatively small number of loans in violation, it is likely she did not come across the files which were treated in a manner by the bank that was contrary to the central bank regulations.

Jones is aware that Alpine currently has very little exposure to this region.

      "question": "<div><div><div>\n<p>One of the discretionary accounts managed by Farnsworth is the Jones Corporation employee profit-sharing plan. Jones, the company president, recently asked Farnsworth to vote the shares in the profit-sharing plan in favor of the slate of directors nominated by Jones Corporation and against the directors sponsored by a dissident stockholder group. Farnsworth does not want to lose this account, because he directs all the account’s trades to a brokerage firm that provides Farnsworth with useful information about tax-free investments. Although this information is not of value in managing the Jones Corporation account, it does help in managing several other accounts. The brokerage firm providing this information also offers the lowest commissions for trades and provides best execution. Farnsworth investigates the director issue, concludes that the management-nominated slate is better for the long-run performance of the company than the dissident group’s slate, and votes accordingly.

      "question": "<div><div><p>Hezi Cohen, a CFA candidate, is a heavy user of social networking sites on the Internet. His favorite site only allows a limited number of characters for each entry so he has learned to abbreviate everything, including CFA trademarks. Cohen also enjoys professional networking sites and contributes regularly to blogs that discuss the broad topical areas covered within the CFA Program. In addition, he posts to these blogs pieces he has written in his area of expertise: retirement planning. By claiming to be an expert on retirement planning, he believes his stature within the investment community increases and he can gain more clients. Which internet activity can Cohen <em>most likely </em>continue to be in compliance with the CFA Standards of Professional Conduct?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use of abbreviations</li>\n<li>Claiming retirement planning expertise</li>\n<li>Blogging about broad topical areas within the CFA Program</li>\n</ol>\n</div></div>",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because according to Standard VII, CFA Institute trademarks are not allowed to be abbreviated. Correct because the Standards do not prevent a person from claiming to be an expert in their area of specialty as long it is not a misrepresentation and/or an exaggeration of their skill and expertise. Incorrect because Standard VII–Responsibilities as a CFA Institute Member or CFA Candidate restricts the disclosing of all aspects of the CFA exam, including broad topical areas. These are considered confidential and thus should not be discussed over the Internet. Guidance for Standards I–VII identify conduct that conforms to the Code and Standards and conduct that violates the Code and Standards",
