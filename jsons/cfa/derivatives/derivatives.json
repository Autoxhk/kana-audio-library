Since the length of the discounting period depends on the maturity of the underlying market reference rate, 1-month market reference rate results in a shorter discounting period than the 3-month rate. Therefore, it will suffer from a smaller convexity bias. Correct because the discounting feature of the FRA, which is not present in the futures contract, leads to a convexity bias that is greater for longer discounting periods. Since the length of the discounting period depends on the maturity of the underlying market reference rate, 3-month market reference rate results in a longer discounting period than the 1-month rate.

Correct because the risk-neutral probability ( π ) is the computed probability used in binomial option pricing by which the discounted weighted sum of expected values of the underlying, S 1 u = R u S 0 and S 1 d = R d S 0 , equal the current option price.

Thus, An increase from $16 to $22 or a decrease from $16 to $12 corresponds to: R u = $22/$16 = 1.375 and R d = $12/$16 = 0.75. Using the risk-neutral probability (π) of a price increase: π = 1 + r – R d / R u – R d = (1 + 0.04 – 0.75) / (1.375 – 0.75) = 0.29/0.625 = 0.464 ≈ 0.46.

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because when benefits exceed the costs, then the forward transaction would return less than the spot transaction. The formula adjusts the forward price downward by the expression – (γ – θ)( 1 + r) T to reflect this net loss over the spot transaction. In other words, acquiring the asset in the forward market would be cheaper because it forgoes benefits that exceed the costs. Therefore, forward price of a commodity will be less than the commodity's spot price compounded at the risk-free rate over the life of the contract when net cost of carry, (γ –θ) , is positive, not when it is zero. Correct because The forward price of an asset with benefits and/or costs is the spot price compounded at the risk-free rate over the life of the contract minus the future value of those benefits and costs. That is, F 0 (T) = S 0 ( 1 +r) T – (γ – θ)( 1 +r) T , where the net cost of carry consists of the benefits, denoted as γ (dividends or interest plus convenience yield), minus the costs, denoted as θ . When net cost of carry is zero, the term (γ – θ) is zero, resulting in (γ – θ)( 1 +r) T being zero. Then, F 0 (T) = S 0 ( 1 +r) T . Hence, the forward price of a commodity is equal to the commodity's spot price compounded at the risk-free rate over the life of the contract when the net cost of carry is zero. Incorrect because if the costs exceeded the benefits, the forward price would be higher because the forward contract avoids the costs at the expense of the lesser benefits. Then, the term (γ – θ)( 1 +r) T will be negative, adding to S 0 (1+ r ) T in absolute terms (due to preceding negative sign), resulting in a forward price that is higher than the spot price compounded at the risk-free rate. Therefore, the forward price of a commodity will be greater than the commodity's spot price compounded at the risk-free rate over the life of the contract when the net cost of carry, (γ – θ) , is negative, not when it is zero.

Incorrect because the differential between forward and futures prices is determined by both the correlation between futures prices and interest rates, and by interest rate volatility, as described in the response rationale for the correct answer.

On the other hand, violations of these assumptions can give rise to differences in pricing between these two contracts. For example, if futures prices are positively correlated with interest rates, long futures contracts are more attractive than long forward positions for the same underlying and maturity. The reason is because rising prices lead to futures profits that are reinvested in periods of rising interest rates, and falling prices lead to losses that occur in periods of falling interest rates.

Only in-the-money puts have moneyness. Incorrect because when the underlying is precisely at the exercise price, the option is said to be at-the-money. Only in-the-money put options have moneyness. Correct because hen the underlying is beyond the exercise price in the appropriate direction (higher for a call, lower for a put), the option is said to be in-the-money. In addition, for puts to expire in-the-money, the value of the underlying must fall below the exercise price. The higher the exercise price, the better chance the underlying has of getting below it. Likewise, if the value of the underlying does fall below the exercise price, the higher the exercise price, the greater the payoff. So, if X is higher, S T will be below it more often, and if S T is less than X, the payoff of X – S T is greater, the higher is X for whatever value of S T occurs. Therefore, a put option with the greatest moneyness has a strike price greater than the price of the underlying.

Correct because the writer of a call is the seller of the call: An option is a derivative contract in which one party, the buyer, pays a sum of money to the other party, the seller or writer, and receives the right to either buy or sell an underlying asset at a fixed price either on a specific expiration date or at any time prior to the expiration date. The profit to the seller of the call is –Max(0, S T – X ) + c 0 , where X is the exercise price, S T is the value of the underlying at expiration and c 0 is the call premium received by the seller.

      "explanation": "Solution A is correct. The CTA will face a margin call if the copper contract price falls by more than $4,000, or $0.16 (= $4,000/25,000) per pound. We may solve for the price at which the CTA receives a margin call by first solving for the initial futures contract price, f 0 ( T ), at contract inception as follows: f 0 ( T ) = [ S 0 + PV 0 ( C )] (1 + r ) T . Solve for PV 0 ( C ) per pound as follows: PV 0 ( C ) = $9.98 (= $10[1.01875 –(1/12) ]). Substitute PV 0 ( C ) = $9.98 into Equation 4 to solve for f 0 ( T ): f 0 ( T ) = [($4.25 × 25,000) + $9.98](1.01875 -(1/12) ) f 0 ( T ) = $106,425 per contract (≈ $4.257 per pound). So, $106,425 − $4,000 = $102,425 per contract, and $4.257 − $0.16 = $4.10 per pound. B is incorrect as it assumes there is no maintenance margin, and while C may be true under some circumstances, the change in A is immediate (occurs at trade inception).",

      "explanation": "Solution B is correct. Since the expected floating cash flows on the swap are the implied forward rates, we first use zero rates to solve for IFRs using Equation 1: (1 + z A ) A × (1 + IFR A , B – A ) B – A = (1 + z B ) B . We may solve for these rates as IFR 0,1 = 2.2727%, IFR 1,1 = 3.7975%, and IFR 2,1 = 4.8525%. We then substitute the respective IFRs discounted by zero rates into the following equation to solve for s 3 : 𝐼 𝐹 𝑅 0 , 1 ( 1 + 𝑧 1 ) + 𝐼 𝐹 𝑅 1 , 1 ( 1 + 𝑧 2 ) 2 + 𝐼 𝐹 𝑅 2 , 1 ( 1 + 𝑧 3 ) 3 = 𝑠 3 ( 1 + 𝑧 1 ) + 𝑠 3 ( 1 + 𝑧 2 ) 2 + 𝑠 3 ( 1 + 𝑧 3 ) 3 I F R 0 , 1 1 + z 1 + I F R 1 , 1 1 + z 2 2 + I F R 2 , 1 1 + z 3 3 = s 3 1 + z 1 + s 3 1 + z 2 2 + s 3 1 + z 3 3 . Solving for the left-hand side of the equation, we get 0.10159 = 2.2727 % 1.022727 + 3.7975 % ( 1.030323 ) 2 + 4.8525 % ( 1.036355 ) 3 = 2.2727 % 1.022727 + 3.7975 % ( 1.030323 ) 2 + 4.8525 % ( 1.036355 ) 3 0.10159 = 2.2727 % 1.022727 + 3.7975 % 1.030323 2 + 4.8525 % 1.036355 3 = 2.2727 % 1.022727 + 3.7975 % 1.030323 2 + 4.8525 % 1.036355 3 Solving for the right-hand side, we get 2.81819 𝑠 3 = [ 1 1.022727 + 1 ( 1.030323 ) 2 + 1 ( 1.036355 ) 3 ] × 𝑠 3 2.81819 s 3 = 1 1.022727 + 1 1.030323 2 + 1 1.036355 3 × s 3 . s 3 = 3.605% = 0.10159 ÷ 2.81819.

      "explanation": "Solution The correct answer is A. Since the put option is overpriced, we would sell it to earn the difference between the price at which it is sold and the no-arbitrage price. The put–call parity relationship, from Equation 1, is S 0 + p 0 = c 0 + X (1 + r ) – T . We can rearrange this to demonstrate that the put option value is equivalent to a long call option, a long risk-free bond, and a short position in CWI shares: p 0 = c 0 + X (1 + r ) – T – S 0 . Answer A reflects this long risk-free bond and short CWI combination, which has a payoff of X – S T at expiration matching that of the put payoff, whereas Answer B involves a long cash position in CWI and Answer C involves a long synthetic (forward purchase) position in CWI stock.",

      "explanation": "Solution The correct answer is C. A 12% increase in the stock price gives: 𝑆 𝑢 1 = 𝑅 𝑢 𝑆 0 = 1.12 × € 105.25 = € 117.88. S 1 u = R u S 0 = 1.12 × € 105.25 = € 117.88. The put option will expire unexercised: 𝑝 𝑢 1 = Max ( 0 , 𝑋 − 𝑆 𝑢 1 ) = Max ( 0 , € 100 − € 117.88 ) = € 0. p 1 u = Max 0 , X − S 1 u = Max 0 , € 100 − € 117.88 = € 0. Alternatively, a 10% price decrease gives: 𝑆 𝑑 1 = 𝑅 𝑑 𝑆 0 = 0.9 × € 105.25 = € 94.73. S 1 d = R d S 0 = 0.9 × € 105.25 = € 94.73. The put option will pay off: 𝑝 𝑑 1 = Max ( 1 , 𝑋 − 𝑆 𝑑 1 ) = Max ( 0 , € 100 − € 94.73 ) = € 5.27. p 1 d = Max 1 , X − S 1 d = Max 0 , € 100 − € 94.73 = € 5.27. To price this option, the risk-neutral pricing formula gives the risk-neutral probability π as: π = (1 + 0.0037 − 0.9)/(1.12 − 0.9) = 0.47. The no-arbitrage price is: 𝑝 0 = ( 𝜋 × 𝑝 𝑢 1 + ( 1 − 𝜋 ) 𝑝 𝑑 1 ) ( 1 + 𝑟 ) p 0 = π × p 1 u + 1 − π p 1 d 1 + r p 0 = (0.47 × €0 + 0.53 × €5.27)/(1 + 0.0037) = €2.79/1.0037 = €2.78.",

      "explanation": "Solution The correct answer is A. If the put option can be purchased for less than the no-arbitrage price, then a potential arbitrage opportunity is available. In this case, Kleinert’s clients should purchase the underpriced put option and buy h * units of SparCoin’s stock. The hedge ratio, h *, is calculated as: ℎ ∗ = ( 𝑝 𝑢 1 − 𝑝 𝑑 1 ) ( 𝑆 𝑢 1 − 𝑆 𝑑 1 ) = € 0 − € 5.27 € 117.88 − € 94.73 = − € 5.27 € 23.15 = − 0.2276. h * = p 1 u − p 1 d S 1 u − S 1 d = € 0 − € 5.27 € 117.88 − € 94.73 = − € 5.27 € 23.15 = − 0.2276. Note that the negative hedge ratio implies that both the put option and underlying are purchased or sold to create a hedge. This initial purchase of the put option and stock will cost: €2.50 + 0.2276 × €105.25 = €26.45. Should the stock price decrease, the value of this portfolio will be: 𝑉 1 = 𝑉 𝑑 1 = ℎ ∗ 𝑆 𝑑 1 + 𝑝 𝑑 1 = 0.2276 × € 94.73 + € 5.27 = € 26.83. V 1 = V 1 d = h * S 1 d + p 1 d = 0.2276 × € 94.73 + € 5.27 = € 26.83. The strategy generates a risk-free return of (€26.83 – €26.45)/€26.45 = 1.44%, which is greater than the 0.37% return on other available risk-free investments.",

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because the principle of no arbitrage and replication can be used to value and price derivatives. In other words, arbitrage opportunities can be exploited using derivatives, but for the pricing of derivatives the no-arbitrage condition is assumed to hold, i.e., no arbitrage opportunities exist. Correct because the law of one price can be used to value a derivative security since there is a one-to-one relationship between the derivative and its underlying asset at maturity. Therefore, there exists only one price for each derivative. Incorrect because the law of one price can be used to value a derivative security since there is a one-to-one relationship between the derivative and its underlying asset at maturity. Further, the one-period binomial model determines the value of a derivative using the underlying's price at t = 0 as an input for the calculation. For example, the price of a call option is c 0 = h x S 0 – V 1 (1 + r) – 1 , where c 0 is the call option value at t = 0 and S 0 is the price of the underlying at t = 0. Therefore, the price of the underlying asset is not inferred when determining the derivative's price. Instead, the price of the underlying asset is considered a given and used as an input in the calculation.

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because 0.25 is simply the expected reduction in percent (down move) of the underlying after one year. Instead, the risk-neutral probability (π) is the computed probability used in binomial option pricing with π = (1 + r – R d ) / (R u – R d ), where π is the risk-neutral probability of an increase in the underlying price, r is the risk-free rate and R d and R u represent the underlying asset volatility, i.e., expected up and down moves of the underlying after the period.
