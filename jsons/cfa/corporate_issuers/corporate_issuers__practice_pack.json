      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Solution Correct because good corporate governance policies on conflicts of interest and related-party transactions require directors and managers to disclose any actual or potential conflict of interest related to the company, as well as any material interests in a transaction that may affect the company. Incorrect because in practice, compensation is the principal tool used to align the interests of management and shareholders. While management compensation seeks to motivate managers to maximize shareholder value, manager and shareholder interests may diverge regarding inappropriate risk appetite. Compensation dominated by stock grants and options can motivate excessive management risk-taking, as option holders participate only in upside share price moves. Similarly, little or no use of stock grants and options in compensation plans can lead to unduly risk-averse corporate decision-making and the inability to attract talent. This misalignment may be at odds with the company’s value creation objective or shareholders’ desire for higher-risk, higher-reward endeavors. Since investors can hold diversified portfolios, they may have a higher risk tolerance than managers, whose reputation and time are concentrated in a single company. Therefore, good corporate governance seeks to align interests of managers and shareholders through effective compensation to avoid excessive or too little risk-taking that is not aligned with shareholder interests. Incorrect because the compensation, or remuneration, committee develops and proposes remuneration policies for the directors and key executives, which often includes setting performance criteria and evaluating manager performance. Companies are increasingly designing incentive plans that discourage “short-termism” or excessive risk-taking by managers. Some incentive plans include granting shares, rather than options, to managers and restricting their vesting or sale for several years or until retirement. A long-term incentive plan delays compensation, either in part or in total, until a company’s strategic objectives (typically performance targets) are met. Therefore, good corporate governance combats short-termism through long-term incentive plans.

The granting of stock-based remuneration does not serve its purpose, however, if managers can improve their personal gains at the expense of the company while limiting their exposure to weak stock performance. A long-term incentive plan delays the payment of remuneration, either partially or in total, until company strategic objectives (typically performance targets) are met. Accordingly, executive payouts that exhibit significant variation over time based on company performance would not indicate a misalignment of interests between executives and investors.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Corporate Governance: Conflicts, Mechanisms, Risks, and Benefits</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>describe corporate governance and mechanisms to manage stakeholder relationships and mitigate associated risks</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because there is no direct relationship between suppliers and creditors. Further, suppliers also have long-term interests in companies, as they seek to build and maintain mutually beneficial relationships. Supplier interest in a company’s long-term stability is important when products are specialized and one or both parties have invested in the relationship through product design, training, or customization. Thus, conflicting interests between suppliers and creditors are not very likely. Further, both customers and suppliers enter into contractual agreements with a company that specify the products and services underlying the relationship, the prices or fees and the payment terms, the rights and responsibilities of each party, the after-sale relationship, and any guarantees. Contracts also specify actions to be taken and recourse available if either party breaches the terms of the contract. Thus, it is not very likely that interests of customers and creditors conflict. Correct because the difference in debt versus equity claims gives rise to potential conflicts of interest. For example, debtholders with a fixed claim tend to be risk averse and prefer that the corporation take actions to ensure sufficient cash flow to meet its debt obligations. For this reason, debtholders tend to prefer that a company raise more equity and limit shareholder distributions. Shareholders, however, tend to prefer greater leverage and shareholder distributions rather than dilutive equity issuance. This potential conflict is greater for long-term debt, as the passage of time exposes debtholders to changes in business conditions, strategy, and management behavior. As a result, long-term creditors are more likely to impose contractual limits on leverage and shareholder distributions. Incorrect because there is no direct relationship between customers and creditors. Also, customers expect a company’s products or services to satisfy their needs at a reasonable price while meeting applicable quality and safety standards.

This incorrect answer choice is the result of assuming the decrease in the tax rate results in a WACC decrease of –25% × 9% = –2.25%.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Incorrect because the change in WACC is an increase from 9.51% to 10.86% = 1.35%, as described in the response rationale for the correct answer. This incorrect answer choice is the result of mixing up pre and post change WACC values, i.e., 9.51% – 10.86% = – 1.35%.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Correct</strong> because the weighted average cost of capital is WACC = [(1 – Tax rate) × Pre-tax cost of debt × Weighting of debt] + (Cost of equity × Weighting of equity). Substituting in yields for a 35% tax rate: WACC = ((1 – 0.35) × 0.09 × 0.60) + (0.15 × 0.40)) = 9.51%. For a 10% tax rate, we get: WACC = ((1 – 0.10) × 0.09 × 0.60) + (0.15 × 0.40)) = 10.86%. Hence, the change in WACC is an increase of 10.86% – 9.51% = 1.35%.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Capital Structure</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>calculate and interpret the weighted-average cost of capital for a company</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
