Conflicts of interest between shareholders and creditors arise typically due to a divergence in risk tolerance regarding the company's investments that exists between shareholders and creditors. Correct because compared with shareholders, managers typically have greater access to information about the business and are more knowledgeable about its operations. Such 'information asymmetry' (that is, unequal access to information) makes it easier for managers to make strategic decisions that are not necessarily in the best interest of shareholders and weakens the ability of shareholders to exercise control. Incorrect because information asymmetry applies between managers and shareholders. Typical conflicts of interest between shareholders and customers arise when, for example, a company decides to charge a high price for its products or reduces product safety features to reduce costs.
