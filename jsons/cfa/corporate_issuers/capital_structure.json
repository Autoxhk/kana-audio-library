Plover plans to issue EUR35.0 million in debt to retire an equivalent amount of equity, so the size of the firm will remain unchanged. The debt will have a cost of 4.5%.

Since the cash flows are assumed to be perpetual, WACC for the unlevered firm is calculated as r WACC = CF (1 – t )/ V = EUR8.0 million/EUR100.0 million = 8.0%. The market value of Plover with the debt financing is EUR107 million: V L = V U + tD = EUR100.0 million + 0.20(EUR35.0 million) = EUR107.0 million. To find the cost of equity, we first need to find the market value of equity: V L = D + E , where D and E are market values of debt and equity, respectively.

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because according to the Modigliani-Miller propositions, an increase in the debt to equity ratio either has no effect on the WACC (Proposition I) or (all else being equal) decreases the WACC (Proposition II). According to MM Proposition I, the value of the company remains unchanged or constant as the capital structure changes. Therefore, the weighted average cost of capital must also remain constant as the capital structure changes. According to MM Proposition II, the cost of equity rises as the company increases the amount of debt in its capital structure, but it rises at a slower rate than in the no-tax case. As debt increases, the WACC decreases and the company’s value increases. Incorrect because an assumption of the Modigliani-Miller Proposition I without taxes is that investors can borrow and lend at the risk-free rate. This means a change in the cost of debt will have no effect on the cost of debt in this case. Further, according to Modigliani-Miller Proposition II with taxes, for a leveraged company the cost of equity will increase by more than the cost of debt if the debt-to-equity ratio increases... r e = r 0 + ( r o – r d )(1 – t ) D / E ...where r e = Cost of equity for a leveraged company, r 0 = Cost of capital for a company financed only with equity, r d = Cost of debt for a leveraged company, t = Company tax rate and D / E = Debt-to-equity ratio. Since r o r d , the cost of equity ( r e ) will increase by more than the cost of debt ( r d ) if the debt-to-equity ratio ( D / E ) increases, even if r d also increases which is not directly contemplated by the text. Correct because as the debt-to-equity ratio increases and the company uses more debt, its risk goes up and the cost of equity must increase. MM Proposition II holds that the increase in the cost of equity must exactly offset the greater use of lower cost debt.

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because it is the weight of the debt, not equity. w d = D/(D + E) = (D/E)/((D/E) + 1) = 0.25/(0.25 + 1) = 0.20. Incorrect because it is 1 – D/E = 0.75. Correct because a simple way of transforming a debt-to-equity ratio (D/E) into a weight— that is, D/(D + E) is to divide D/E by 1 + D/E. Accordingly, w e = 1 – w d ; and w d = D/(D + E) = (D/E)/((D/E) + 1) = 0.25/(0.25 + 1) = 0.2. Therefore w e = 1 – 0.2 = 0.80. Capital Structure describe optimal and target capital structures",
