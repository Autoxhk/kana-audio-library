      "question": "<div><div><p>Which of the following statements about a mature company's stakeholders is <em>most</em> accurate?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Equity represents a cheaper financing source for companies</li>\n<li>Shareholders are residual claimants to the company after all other stakeholders have been paid</li>\n<li>Dividend payments to company shareholders are generally treated as a tax-deductible expense for the company</li>\n</ol>\n</div></div>",
      "choices": {},
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because this holds for debt, not equity. Equityholders represent a more permanent source of capital and have voting rights to elect the board of directors, which oversees the management of the company. In contrast, debt represents a cheaper financing source for companies and a lower risk for investors. Correct because debtholders have a prior legal claim on the company’s cash flows and assets over the claims of equity owners. Equityholders [shareholders] are therefore residual claimants to the company after all other stakeholders have been paid, including creditors (interest/principal), suppliers (accounts payable), government (taxes), and employees (wages). Incorrect because another difference is that interest payments to debtholders are generally treated as a tax-deductible expense for the company, while dividend payments to shareholders are not. Investors and Other Stakeholders compare the financial claims and motivations of lenders and shareholders",

      "choices": {},
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because the maximum loss equity owners face is limited to the amount of their equity investment. Correct because however, an equity owner has the potential for significant upside gain, dependent on future share price increases. If the corporation is successful, there is theoretically no limit to how much equity owners could make from their investment. Incorrect because stocks are considered riskier for investors, however, because the company has no contractual obligation to distribute funds to shareholders or repay their capital investment. Also, with a fixed priority claim, bondholders are contractually promised priority in receiving their specified interest payment with return of principal.
