Due to multiple partners and partnership agreement, this structure is not as simple and flexible as a sole proprietorship. Key features of sole proprietorships include: Operational simplicity and flexibility.

      "explanation": "Solution C is correct. The limited partners of DAG LP are not shareholders of DAG Inc., so they do not have voting rights in the corporation. Additionally, because the limited partners own only 20% of the partnership, they also have little ability to remove DAG Inc. as the general partner. In contrast, outside shareholders own 70% of DAG Inc. and have voting rights. They could use their collective ownership to effect change in the management of DAG Inc. A is incorrect. Neither the DAG LP limited partners nor the outside shareholders of DAG Inc. have managerial responsibilities. The general partner has managerial responsibilities of the partnership, and the board of DAG Inc. has managerial responsibilities of the corporation. B is incorrect. Owing to the special corporate form of DAG Inc., both the corporation and the limited partnership are pass-through entities. Therefore, neither the partnership nor the corporation pays entity-level income taxes, but both the limited partners and shareholders are responsible for personal income taxes.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Solution A is correct. The Dee family can effectively control management of the timber and forest assets with only a 24% effective ownership stake in the partnership. If the family had opted for a limited partnership as the organizational form, they likely would need a much higher ownership stake to assert management control and would have unlimited personal liability. B is incorrect. The double taxation problem is not an issue in the more complex structure, nor is it a problem in the partnership structure, because both are pass-throughs. C is incorrect. The complex structure potentially creates problems because of the existence of outside shareholders constituting a majority of votes.",
