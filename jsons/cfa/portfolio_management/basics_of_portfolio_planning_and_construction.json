For example, an investor with a 20-year time horizon can be considered to have a greater ability to bear risk, other things being equal, than an investor with a 2-year horizon.

The risk–return profile of the strategic asset allocation depends on the expected returns and risks of the individual asset classes, as well as the correlation between those asset classes. On the other hand, security selection is an attempt to generate higher returns than the asset class benchmark by selecting securities with a higher expected return. An alpha process is a process for adding value through active investing.

On the other hand, tactical asset allocation is the decision to deliberately deviate from the policy exposures to systematic risk factors (i.e., the policy weights of asset classes) with the intent to add value based on forecasts of the near-term returns of those asset classes. Correct because as the portfolio is constructed and its value changes with the returns of the asset classes and securities in which it is invested, the weights of the asset classes will gradually deviate from the policy weights in the strategic asset allocation.

Therefore, using solely the data given in the table, returns on Brazilian equities are most sharply distinguished from returns on US equities.</p>\n</div>",
