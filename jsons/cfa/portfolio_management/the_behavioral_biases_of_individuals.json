      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Solution A is correct. Under-diversified portfolios are a consequence of both illusion of control and confirmation biases. Researchers have found that some investors prefer to invest in companies that they feel they have control over, such as the companies they work for, leading them to hold concentrated positions. Confirmation bias may lead to FMPs ignoring negative news, paying attention only to information confirming that a company is a good investment, which may result in large positions. Representativeness bias is not typically associated with under-diversified portfolios.",

This bias is evident in FMPs that systematically and materially overvalue securities in their portfolio versus securities not in their portfolio. The question “Would you buy this security today at the current price?” turns the investor’s attention to assessing the reasonableness of the current price as a buy price rather than solely as a selling price.",

Although its growth began to decelerate sharply by 1990, it was not until the mid to late 1990s that FMPs’ GDP forecasts were consistently achieved.

Representativeness refers to the tendency to adopt a view or forecast based on individual information or a small sample, as well to use simple classifications.
