'The Doctrine of No Surprises' is a key mantra among many risk managers, but it does not mean they are expected to predict what will happen. For example, a risk manager of a bank would not have been expected to know that a real estate crisis was going to occur and cause significant defaults on the bank's real estate securities. Correct because a good risk management process would include a deep discussion at the governance level about the balance between the likely returns and the unlikely—but sizable—losses and whether such losses are tolerable. Incorrect because a poor risk management process would have ignored the possibility, though small, of such a significant market event and not quantified the potential loss.

      "explanation": "Solution Correct because –0.5 is the smallest of the three correlations and the closer the correlation coefficient is to –1, the greater the reduction in portfolio risk. The correlation coefficient between two assets determines the effect on portfolio risk when the two assets are combined. You will find that portfolio risk is unaffected when the two assets are perfectly correlated (ρ 12 = +1). In other words, the portfolio's standard deviation is simply a weighted average of the standard deviations of the two assets and as such a portfolio's risk is unchanged with the addition of assets with the same risk parameters. Portfolio risk falls, however, when the two assets are not perfectly correlated (ρ 12 < +1). Sufficiently low values of the correlation coefficient can make the portfolio riskless under certain conditions. For an extreme case in which ρ 12 = –1 (that is, the two asset returns move in opposite directions), the portfolio can be made risk free. Analytically, the standard deviation risk of a two asset portfolio is given by the square root of the portfolio's variance: σ P = ( w 1 2 σ 1 2 + w 2 2 σ 2 2 + 2 w 1 w 2 ρ 12 σ 1 σ 2 ) 1/2 , which is a strictly increasing function of ρ 12 .

      "explanation": "Solution Correct because the risk–return profile of the strategic asset allocation depends on the expected returns and risks of the individual asset classes, as well as the correlation between those asset classes. Incorrect because the risk–return profile of the strategic asset allocation depends on the expected returns and risks of the individual asset classes, as well as the correlation between those asset classes. Deciding to deviate from policy weights or to select securities aiming to beat the benchmark creates additional uncertainty about returns. This risk is over and above the risk inherent in the policy portfolio. Hence, an investment policy should set risk limits and desired payoffs for each of these activities. Risk budgeting implies that the portfolio manager has to choose, for every asset class, whether to deploy security selection as a return generator. Although security selection could impact the returns of a portfolio, the risk–return profile of a portfolio's strategic asset allocation is based on expected returns for the asset classes and the correlation between those asset classes rather than the additional risk associated with the use of security selection. Incorrect because the risk–return profile of the strategic asset allocation depends on the expected returns and risks of the individual asset classes, as well as the correlation between those asset classes. As the portfolio is constructed and its value changes with the returns of the asset classes and securities in which it is invested, the weights of the asset classes will gradually deviate from the policy weights in the strategic asset allocation. This process is referred to as drift. Periodically, or when a certain threshold deviation from the policy weight (the bandwidth) has been breached, the portfolio should be rebalanced back to the policy weights. The set of rules that guide the process of restoring the portfolio's original exposures to systematic risk factors is known as the rebalancing policy . Deciding to deviate from policy weights or to select securities aiming to beat the benchmark creates additional uncertainty about returns. This risk is over and above the risk inherent in the policy portfolio.

Risk budgeting implies that the portfolio manager has to choose, for every asset class, whether to deploy security selection as a return generator.

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because the equally weighted portfolio's return is the same as the return on the randomly selected security. Thus, a portfolio's expected return is not influenced by the correlations between assets. The portfolio return varies with weights but is unaffected by the correlation coefficient. Incorrect because the standard deviation of an equally weighted portfolio is not simply the average of the standard deviations of the individual shares. Such a portfolio offers a lower standard deviation of return than the average of its individual components due to the correlations or interactions between the individual securities. Thus, a portfolio's standard deviation of returns is influenced by the correlations between assets. For example, the standard deviation of a two-asset portfolio simplifies to the following: σ p = √( w 1 2 σ 1 2 + w 2 2 σ 2 2 + 2 w 1 w 2 ρ 12 σ 1 σ 2 ). It follows that an increase in the correlation among assets will result in an increase in the portfolio's standard deviation, not a decrease. Correct because, as the correlations between asset returns increase, the diversification benefit provided by portfolios decreases. A major reason that portfolios can effectively reduce risk is that combining securities whose returns do not move together provides diversification. However, an important issue is that the co-movement or correlation pattern of the securities' returns in the portfolio can change in a manner unfavorable to the investor. When we examine the returns of a set of global equity indexes over the last 15 years, we observe a reduction in the diversification benefit due to a change in the pattern of co-movements of returns. The degree to which these global equity indexes move together has increased over time. The lesson is that although portfolio diversification generally does reduce risk, it does not necessarily provide the same level of risk reduction during times of severe market turmoil as it does when the economy and markets are operating ‘normally'.

Moreover, the word 'decision' highlights that it is not an external requirement, which would be the case if it was required by law or regulation. Incorrect because this constraint is driven by economic considerations of the client, and thus would be reflected in the tax concerns section of the IPS, and not in the legal and regulatory constraints. In many cases, the portfolio should reflect the tax status of the client. For example, a taxable investor may wish to hold a portfolio that emphasizes capital gains and receives little income. Correct because when an individual has access to material nonpublic information about a particular security, this situation may also form a [legal and regulatory] constraint. For example, the directors of a public company may need to refrain from trading the company's stock at certain points of the year before financial results are published.

Alternatively, after calculating the nominal return via $150,000(1 + r ) 15 = $500,000, it then adjusts for inflation by subtracting, rather than adding, the expected inflation rate from the nominal rate; [$500,000/$150,000] 1/15 – 1 – 0.02 = 8.4% – 2.0% = 6.4%, which is closest to this response. Incorrect because it does not take into account the effect of inflation on the individual's retirement income needs.

Hence, the minimum required rate of return, r , satisfies $150,000(1 + r ) 15 = $500,000, giving r = [$500,000/$150,000] 1/15 – 1 = 0.084 = 8.4%. Calculator solution: N = 15; PV = –150,000; FV = 500,000; compute I/Y = 8.4%. Correct because, at 2% annual inflation, $500,000 in today's money equates to $500,00(1.02) 15 = $672,934 in 15 years' time. Since no further contributions to the retirement fund will be made, the current savings of $150,000 must grow to at least $672,934 in 15 years' time to meet the individual's retirement income objective. Hence, the minimum required rate of return, r , satisfies $150,000(1 + r ) 15 = $672,934, giving r = [$672,934/$150,000] 1/15 – 1 = 0.105 = 10.5%.

Alternatively, a candidate could compute the nominal required rate of return via $150,000(1 + r ) 15 = $500,000, giving r = [$500,000/$150,000] 1/15 – 1 = 0.084 = 8.4%, and then adjust for inflation as follows: (1 + 0.084) × (1 + 0.02) – 1 = 0.105 = 10.5%. If a candidate adjusted for inflation by adding the expected inflation rate, they would also arrive at (approximately) the correct answer; 8.4% + 2.0% = 10.4%.
