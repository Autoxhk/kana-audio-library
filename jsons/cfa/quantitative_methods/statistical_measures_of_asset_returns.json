      "explanation": "Solution Correct . The position of the first quintile is found with the following formula: L y = ( n + 1) × ( y /100),where y = the percentage point at which the distribution is divided. In this case, y = 20, which corresponds to the 20th percentile (first quintile) n = the number of observations (funds) in the peer group. In this case, n = 13 L 20 = the location of the 20th percentile (first quintile) L 20 = (13 + 1) × (20/100) = 2.80. Therefore, the location of the first quintile is between the volatility of Fund 2 and Fund 3 (because they are ranked in ascending order). Linear interpolation is used to find the approximate value of the first quintile: P 20 ≈ X 2 + (2.80 − 2) × ( X 3 − X 2 ) where X 2 = the volatility of Fund 2 X 3 = the volatility of Fund 3 P 20 = the approximate value of the first quintile P 20 ≈ 10.12% + (2.80 − 2) × (10.84% − 10.12%) = 10.70% Incorrect. It is the approximate value of the first quartile . The position of the first quartile is found as follows: L 25 = (13 + 1) × (25/100) = 3.50. So, the location of the first quartile is between the volatility of Fund 3 and Fund 4. Linear interpolation is used to find the approximate value of the first quartile: P 25 ≈ X 3 + (3.50 − 3) × ( X 4 − X 3 ) P 25 ≈ 10.84% + (3.50 − 3) × (11.33% − 10.84%) = 11.09% Incorrect. The position of the first quintile is found with the following formula: L y = ( n + 1) × ( y /100) L 20 = (13 + 1) × (20/100) = 2.80. 2.80 is then rounded up to 3 and the volatility of Fund 3 is taken. That corresponds to 10.84%. Statistical Measures of Asset Returns calculate, interpret, and evaluate measures of central tendency and location to address an investment problem",

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because n (5) is used in the calculation instead of n – 1: (14/5) 0.5 , resulting in 1.67% ≈ 1.7%. Correct because the formula for target downside deviation is [Σ( X i – B ) 2 /( n – 1)] 0.5 , where X i is the return for the period, B is the target return and n is the total number of sample observations. Moreover, the summation is taken over only those observations ( X i ) that are less than or equal to the target B . Year Return (%) Deviations from the target Squared deviations 1 6 0 0 2 7 0 0 3 3 –2 4 4 2 –3 9 5 4 –1 1 Since the sum of squared deviations is 14, the target downside deviation = [14/(5 – 1)] 0.5 , resulting in 1.87% ≈ 1.9%. Incorrect because all the returns are used in the calculation, not just the returns below the target. In other words, the standard deviation from the target return is calculated. Since the sum of all squared deviations is 14 + 5 = 19, the target downside deviation is calculated as: [19/(5 – 1)] 0.5 , resulting in 2.18% ≈ 2.2%. This answer is also closest if n is assumed to be the number of observations used in the correct calculation (3): (14/3) 0.5 , resulting in 2.16% ≈ 2.2%.
