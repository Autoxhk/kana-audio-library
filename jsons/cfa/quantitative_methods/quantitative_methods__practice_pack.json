Setting the PV of the cash outflows (the annuity) equal to the PV of the cash inflows (the return in 15 years), we can solve for the annual payment amount; A = $277,632.25/8.4353 ≈ $32,913.

An alternative approach evaluates only downside risk. We discuss one such approach, safety-first rules, as it provides an excellent illustration of the application of normal distribution theory to practical investment problems. Safety-first rules focus on shortfall risk, the risk that portfolio value will fall below some minimum acceptable level over some time horizon. Roy's safety-first criterion states that the optimal portfolio minimizes the probability that portfolio return, R P , falls below the threshold level, R L . Incorrect because the safety-first ratio uses standard deviation, not semideviation, as a risk measure. The safety-first optimal portfolio maximizes the safety-first ratio (SFRatio): SFRatio = [ E ( R P ) – R L ]/σ P . The quantity E ( R P ) − R L is the distance from the mean return to the shortfall level. Dividing this distance by σ P gives the distance in units of standard deviation. Although not used in Roy's safety-first criterion, semivariance, semideviation, and related dispersion measures [also] focus on downside risk. Semivariance is defined as the average squared deviation below the mean. Semideviation (sometimes called semistandard deviation) is the positive square root of semivariance. Incorrect because Roy's safety-first criterion assumes that portfolio returns are normally distributed. If returns are normally distributed, the safety-first optimal portfolio maximizes the safety-first ratio (SFRatio): SFRatio = [ E ( R P ) – R L ]/σ P . The normal distribution, however, is less suitable as a model for asset prices than as a model for returns. A normal random variable has no lower limit. This characteristic has several implications for investment applications. An asset price can drop only to 0, at which point the asset becomes worthless.

Since each scenario is equally likely (probability = 1/3), E ( X ) = (2.0 + 2.2 + 2.4)/3 = 2.2, so σ 2 ( X ) = [(2.0 – 2.2) 2 + (2.2 – 2.2) 2 + (2.4 – 2.2) 2 ]/3 = [0.04 + 0.04]/3 = 0.08/3 = 0.0267 ≈ 0.03 [in $ 2 ].

Since each scenario is equally likely (probability = 1/3), E(X) = (2.0 + 2.2 + 2.4)/3 = 2.2, so σ 2 ( X ) = [(2.0 – 2.2) 2 + (2.2 – 2.2) 2 + (2.4 – 2.2) 2 ]/3 = [0.04 + 0.04]/3 = 0.08/3 = 0.0267 [in $ 2 ]. Standard deviation is the positive square root of variance. Therefore, σ( X ) = (0.0267) 0.5 = 0.1633 ≈ 0.16 [in $].

The first step is to compute the present value of an ordinary annuity at t = 2 because the first annuity payment is then one period away, as PV 2 = A [1 – 1/(1 + r ) N ] / r = $1,000 × [1 – 1/(1 + 0.06) 5 /0.06 = $4,212.36. Using the present value formula for a lump sum to bring the single cash flow from t = 2 to t = 0, PV 0 = FV N (1 + r) – N = $4,212.36 (1 + 0.06) –2 = $3,748.99 ~ $3,749. Calculator solution: (1) END mode; N = 5; I = 6%; PMT = −1,000; FV = 0; solve for PV = 4,212.36. (2) END mode; N = 2; I = 6%; PMT = 0; FV = 4,212.36; solve for PV = 3,748.99 ~ 3,749. A second method to compute the present value of the investment is to recognize it as an annuity due with first payment at t = 3, and then discount back three periods using the present value formula for a lump sum. PV 3 ; = { A [1 – 1/(1 + r ) N ] / r }(1 + r ) = $1,000 × {[1 – 1/(1 + 0.06) 5 ]/0.06} × (1 + 0.06) = $4,465.11. Using the present value formula for a lump sum to bring the single cash flow from t = 3 to t = 0, PV 0 = FV N (1 + r) – N = $4,465.11 (1 + 0.06) –3 = $3,748.99 ~ $3,749. Calculator solution: (1) BGN mode; N = 5; I = 6%; PMT = −1,000; FV = 0; solve for PV = 4,465.11. (2) END mode; N = 3; I = 6%; PMT = 0; FV = 4,465.11; solve for PV = 3,748.99 ~ 3,749. Another method to compute the correct answer is to calculate the present value of a series of equal cash flows, with the first cash flow in the third year. Using a calculator with CF 0 =0, CF 1 =0, CF 2 =0, CF 3 =1000, CF 4 =1000, CF 5 =1000, CF 6 =1000, CF 7 =1000; I=6%; solve for NPV= 3,748.99 ~ 3,749. Incorrect because it is the present value of the investment as t = 2 instead of t = 0, and it is an intermediate step in the correct calculation. It computes present value of an ordinary annuity at t = 3 as PV 3 = A [1 – 1/(1 + r ) N ] / r = $1,000 × [1 – 1/(1 + 0.06) 5 / 0.06 = $4,212.36. Calculator solution: END mode; N = 5; I = 6%; PMT = −1,000; FV = 0; solve for PV = 4,212.36 ~ 4,212.

In an even-numbered sample, we define the median as the mean of the values of items occupying the n/2 and (n + 2)/2 positions (the two middle items).

      "explanation": "Solution Correct because a holding period return is the return earned from holding an asset for a single specified period of time. This return can be generalized and shown as a mathematical expression in which P is the price and I is the income: R = [( P 1 – P 0 ) + I 1 ]/ P 0 . The subscript indicates the time of the price or income, ( t = 0), is the beginning of the period and ( t = 1) is the end of the period. Hence, P 1 = R × P 0 + P 0 – I 1 = –10.2% × $450 + $450 − $2 = $402.1 ≈ $402. Incorrect because if the stock was sold for $404, the holding period return would be ($404 – $450 + $2)/$450 = –9.8%. The incorrect price of $404 ignores the impact of the dividend; holding period return (HPR) = ( P 1 − P 0 )/ P 0 ; P 1 = HPR × P 0 + P 0 = –10.2% × $450 + $450 = $404.1 ≈ $404. Incorrect because if the stock was sold for $406, the holding period return would be ($406 – $450 + $2)/$450 = –9.3%. The incorrect price of $406 incorrectly subtracts the dividend; holding period return (HPR) = [( P 1 − P 0 ) – I 1 ]/ P 0 ; P 1 = HPR × P 0 + P 0 + I 1 = –10.2% × $450 + $450 + $2 = $406.1 ≈ $406.

Correct because if returns are normally distributed, the safety-first optimal portfolio maximizes the safety-first ratio. SFRatio = [ E ( R P ) – R L ] / σ P , where E ( R P ) is the expected portfolio return, R L is the investor's minimum acceptable return, and σ P is the standard deviation of portfolio returns. The minimum acceptable return is 5% (= €5,000 / €100,000) as the investor needs to withdraw €5,000 without invading initial capital; SF P1 = (23% – 5%) / 15% = 1.20; SF P2 = (12% – 5%) / 6% ≈ 1.17; SF P3 = (15% – 5%) / 8% = 1.25. Therefore, Portfolio 3 is the safety-first optimal portfolio. “The portfolio for which E ( R P ) − R L is largest relative to standard deviation minimizes P ( R P R L ).

US T-bills, for example, do not bear a liquidity premium because large amounts can be bought and sold without affecting their market price. Incorrect because the maturity premium compensates investors for the increased sensitivity of the market value of debt to a change in market interest rates as maturity is extended.

The same result is obtained if the holding period return is calculated as R = ($100 – $107 + $7)/$107 = $0/$107 = 0%. Incorrect because it omits the dividend and calculates R = ($107 – $100)/$100 = $7/$100 = 7%. It is also the ratio of the dividend received over the initial investment; $7/$100 = 7%. Correct because a holding period return is the return earned from holding an asset for a single specified period of time. This return can be generalized and shown as a mathematical expression in which P is the price and I is the income: R = ( P 1 − P 0 + D 1 )/ P 0 Thus, R = ($107 – $100 + $7)/$100 = $14/$100 = 14%.
