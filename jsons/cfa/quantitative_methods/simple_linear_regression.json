      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because we look at the sum of squared deviations of the observations from the mean to capture [the variation of the dependent variable]. Our goal is to understand what explains the variation of Y. The variation of Y is often referred to as the sum of squares total (SST), or the total sum of squares. Therefore, the difference between an observation and the mean of the dependent variable is not the observation's residual. Correct because the residual for the i th observation, e i , is how much the observed value of Y i differs from the estimated [value] using the regression line. Further, the residual refers to the fitted linear relation based on the sample. Incorrect because the error term refers to the true underlying population relationship, whereas the residual refers to the fitted linear relation based on the sample. Further, the error term, or simply the error, represents the difference between the observed value of Y and that expected from the true underlying population relation between Y and X . Simple Linear Regression describe a simple linear regression model, how the least squares criterion is used to estimate regression coefficients, and the interpretation of these coefficients",
