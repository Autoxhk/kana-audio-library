      "question": "<div><div><p>David Smith purchased a mortgage-backed security with a coupon rate of 8% and a par value of $1,000 for $960. Coupon payments are made monthly.

      "choices": {},
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because $6.40 is the monthly payment derived using the purchase price instead of par value: 8% × $960/12 = $6.40. Correct because the annual coupon is 8% × $1,000 = $80. The coupon payments are made monthly, and therefore $80/12 = $6.67 is paid twelve times a year. Incorrect because $6.94 is based on the following calculation: 8%/960 × 1,000 × 100/12 = $6.94. Fixed-Income Instrument Features describe the features of a fixed-income security",

Secured corporate bonds rely on the operating cash flows of the firm as their primary source for interest and principal payments and a legal claim on assets as a secondary source of payment. A is incorrect because asset-backed securities (ABS) are issued by special-purpose entities created to take ownership in loans or receivables, the cash flows from which are used to pay interest and principal to investors.
