      "explanation": "Solution Correct because the general formula for the relationship between two spot rates and the implied forward rate is: (1 + z A ) A × (1 + IFR A,B-A ) B-A = (1 + z B ) B , where z x is the x-year spot rate and IFR x,y is the y-year forward rate, x years from now. Using the formula, the 6 year spot rate can be calculated in two different ways: 1. Using A = 2, B = 6: (1 + z 6 ) 6 = (1 + z 2 ) 2 × (1 + IFR 2,4 ) 4 2. Using A = 4, B = 6: (1 + z 6 ) 6 = (1 + z 4 ) 4 × (1 + IFR 4,2 ) 2 Equating the two we get: (1 + z 2 ) 2 × (1 + IFR 2,4 ) 4 = (1 + z 4 ) 4 × (1 + IFR 4,2 ) 2 .

Incorrect because within unsecured debt, there can also be finer gradations and seniority rankings. The highest-ranked unsecured debt is senior unsecured debt. It is the most common type of all corporate bonds outstanding. Other, lower-ranked debt includes subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt.

Effective duration is essential to the measurement of the interest rate risk of a complex bond, such as a bond that contains an embedded call option.

This additional term is a positive amount on a traditional (option-free) fixed-rate bond for either an increase or decrease in the yield. Incorrect because negative convexity, which could be called 'concavity,' is an important feature of callable bonds. As a second-order effect, effective convexity indicates the change in the first-order effect (i.e., effective duration) as the benchmark yield curve is changed. But the slope of the line tangent to the callable bond flattens as the benchmark yield goes down. Technically, it reaches an inflection point, which is when the effective convexity shifts from positive to negative. In summary, when the benchmark yield is high and the value of the embedded call option is low, the callable and the non-callable bonds experience very similar effects from interest rate changes. They both have positive convexity. But as the benchmark yield is reduced, the curves diverge. At some point, the callable bond moves into the range of negative convexity, which indicates that the embedded call option has more value to the issuer and is more likely to be exercised. Therefore, the convexity adjustment is not negative for a callable bond when the value of the option is low; it can be negative only when the option value is high.

This additional term is a positive amount on a traditional (option-free) fixed-rate bond for either an increase or decrease in the yield. The convexity measure is positive in response to interest rate changes, regardless of the change in yields up or down. For bonds with a call option, the convexity adjustment may positive or negative, but that is based on the level, or moneyness, of the call option, not based on the change in interest rates.

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because the yield-to-maturity, r ytm is: 105 = 4/(1 + r ytm ) 1 + 4/(1 + r ytm ) 2 + 4/(1 + r ytm ) 3 + 104/(1 + r ytm ) 4 Using a financial calculator with N = 4, PV = –105, FV = 100, PMT = 4 and solving for I, r ytm = 2.6656% ≈ 2.7%. Although less than the yield to first call of 2.9%, the YTM is greater (better) than the yield to second call of 2.6%, making the latter the yield to worst. Incorrect because the yield-to-first-call, r 1 is: 105 = 4/(1 + r 1 ) 1 + (4+103)/(1 + r 1 ) 2 Using a financial calculator with N = 2, PV = –105, FV = 103, PMT = 4 and solving for I, r 1 = 2.8706% ≈ 2.9%. This yield is greater (better) than both the yield to second call of 2.6% (which is the lowest, or worst) and the YTM of 2.7%. Correct because the lowest of the sequence of yields-to-call and the yield-to-maturity is known as the yield-to-worst. The sequence of yields for the bond is as follows: Yield-to-maturity, r ytm is calculated by solving this equation: 105 = 4/(1 + r ytm ) 1 + 4/(1 + r ytm ) 2 + 4/(1 + r ytm ) 3 + 104/(1 + r ytm ) 4 Using a financial calculator with N = 4, PV = –105, FV = 100, PMT = 4 and solving for I, r ytm = 2.6656% ≈ 2.7%.

Yield-to-second-call, r 2 is calculated by solving this equation: 105 = 4/(1 + r 2 ) 1 + 4/(1 + r 2 ) 2 + (4+101)/(1 + r 2 ) 3 Using a financial calculator with N = 3, PV = –105, FV = 101, PMT = 4 and solving for I, r 2 = 2.5718% ≈ 2.6%. Therefore the yield-to-worst is equal to the yield-to-second-call.

Incorrect because the duration of a callable bond is not the sensitivity of the bond price to a change in the yield-to-worst (i.e., the lowest of the yield-to-maturity, yield-to-first-call, yield-to-second-call, and so forth). In contrast to effective duration, key rate durations help identify 'shaping risk' for a bond–that is, a bond’s sensitivity to changes in the shape of the benchmark yield curve (e.g., the yield curve becoming steeper or flatter). Correct because key rate duration (or partial duration ) is a measure of a bond’s sensitivity to a change in the benchmark yield curve at a specific maturity segment. In contrast to effective duration, key rate durations help identify 'shaping risk' for a bond—that is, a bond’s sensitivity to changes in the shape of the benchmark yield curve (e.g., the yield curve becoming steeper or flatter).

These metrics are typically determined from bond prices derived using an option valuation model, given specific (parallel) changes in the underlying benchmark government yield curve. Incorrect because bonds with embedded options do not have well-defined yields-to-maturity, so Macaulay and modified durations are not appropriate interest rate risk measures for such bonds. Rather, the appropriate measure of interest rate risk is the sensitivity of the bond’s price to a change in a benchmark yield curve —for example, the government par curve—known as effective duration, a curve duration rather than a yield duration statistic. The credit spread is a component of the yield to maturity, a yield duration statistic, while effective duration is a curve duration. Correct because if a bond has contingency features, such as embedded options, as with a callable (or puttable) bond, then future cash flows are uncertain since option exercise depends on the level of market interest rates relative to coupon interest being paid (or received).
