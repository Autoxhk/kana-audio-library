      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Solution C is correct. Public sector financial accounting standards vary widely and are often prepared using cash, rather than accrual-based, principles, typically excluding such items as the depreciation of fixed public goods, such as federal highways, or the accrual of unfunded liabilities, such as government pension obligations. A and B are incorrect because balance sheets of government entities are likely to include FX reserves and long-term debt.",

      "choices": {},
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because these are known as sovereign bonds even if they are denominated in a foreign currency. In the case of emerging market sovereign issuers, it is important to further distinguish between domestic debt issued in the domestic currency and external debt. External debt of emerging and frontier market sovereign issuers comprises debt from supranational financial organizations and debt issuance denominated in a foreign currency held by foreign private investors. Incorrect because these are are known as non-sovereign bonds. Some non-sovereign government issuers are similar to sovereign borrowers in that they can levy taxes to fund activities in their jurisdiction. Correct because Government agencies are quasi-government entities that issue debt in order to fund the government-sponsored provision of specific public goods or services based on sovereign or local law. This may involve the financing of specific activities promoted by the government or the operation of necessary infrastructure as mandated by law. For example, the Airport Authority of Hong Kong (AAHK), introduced in an earlier module, is the statutory agency for operating and developing the Hong Kong International Airport. AAHK issues a combination of short- and long-term debt to meet the airport’s specific working capital and capital investment needs. The primary source of repayment is cash flows from airport operations, while its sovereign government backing is a secondary source of repayment.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Solution C is correct. Governments seek to minimize interest rate and rollover risks by distributing debt across maturities while issuing debt in regular, predictable intervals. A and B are incorrect because taxpayers are neither able to perfectly smooth consumption over time, nor do they form rational expectations about current versus future taxes across generations, leading to fiscal instability, creating uncertainty in future tax rates, and threatening the stability of economic growth over time.",

For the Airport Authority of Hong Kong, for example, the primary source of repayment is cash flows from airport operations, while its sovereign government backing is a secondary source of repayment. Similarly, the primary source of repayment for Ginnie Mae is mortgage-based guaranty fees and other cash flows, with its sovereign government backing as a secondary source of repayment. A is incorrect because while sovereign agencies typically borrow at a yield-to-maturity near that of their sovereign guarantor, they do not benefit from the full liquidity premium associated with sovereign debt. C is incorrect because agencies issue a combination of short- and long-term debt to meet specific working capital and capital investment needs.",
