      "explanation": "Solution C is correct. The absolute amount of the price increase would be more than the absolute amount of the price decrease for the same absolute change in YTM because of the convex relationship between bond price and yield. A is incorrect because of the positive convex relationship between bond price and yield. For a given level of yield change, the price rise for that given amount of yield decrease will be larger than the price decline for that amount of yield increase. B is incorrect because the relationship between bond price and yield is not linear.",
