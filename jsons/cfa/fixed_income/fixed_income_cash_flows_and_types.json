Incorrect because the investor will face neither a capital gain nor a loss as the original issue discount tax provision allows the investor to increase the cost basis of the bond. Correct because for bonds such as zero-coupon bonds issued at a discount, the tax status of the original issue discount (OID) is an additional tax consideration that varies by country. The OID is the difference between the par value and the original issue price. For example, the United States includes a prorated portion of the discount in interest income every tax year, while Japan does not. Under the OID tax provision, the investor will recognize a prorated portion of the OID as taxable income each year and pay no capital gains tax upon maturity. Investors without an OID tax provision will recognize no taxable income until maturity, upon which they will face capital gains tax on the OID (provided there is capital gains tax in their jurisdiction).
