      "explanation": "Solution Correct. Credit tranching allows investors to choose between subordinate and senior bond classes as a means of credit enhancement. The purpose of this structure is to redistribute the credit risk associated with the collateral. Incorrect because extension and contraction risks refer to the types of prepayment risks in a securitization structure. Incorrect because partially and fully amortizing loans refer to two ways in which the loan principal can be repaid. Asset-Backed Security (ABS) Instrument and Market Features describe typical credit enhancement structures used in securitizations",

      "explanation": "Solution The correct answer is C. In a true securitization, the specific pool of assets is removed from the balance sheet and transferred into a separate and independent legal entity that then issues securities backed by these pooled assets. A is incorrect because credit tranching offers credit protection for the more senior bond classes in a securitization not the equity tranche. B is incorrect because covered bonds, not pass-through securities, are the simplest securitization structure, which involves the issuer retaining the underlying assets on its balance sheet.",

B is incorrect because while investors also have recourse to the unencumbered assets of the issuer, those serve as a subsequent safeguard.

Overcollateralization, one of the three main types of internal credit enhancements used in securitization transactions, is a provision that the collateral underlying the transaction is larger than the face value of the issued bonds. The extra collateral provides a cushion to cover losses from defaults in the underlying pool of collateral.

      "explanation": "Solution The correct answer is C. Triggering rapid amortization provisions accelerates and alters principal cash flows. Noteholders will receive their investments earlier, which they can then reallocate to other investments offering more attractive risk/return characteristics. A is incorrect because typically during the revolving period, as credit cards are non-amortizing loans, the security holders receive only payments from the finance charges and fees the lender collects. Returned principal is reinvested in the collateral pool. B is incorrect because when floating-rate cap exceeds the rate cardholders must pay, there is no related binding limit on finance payments.",

      "explanation": "Solution The correct answer is B. Default risk minimization adds to investment appeal, and solar loans provide opportunities for overcollateralization. Normally, solar ABS are collateralized by the underlying debt: mortgages, loans, or receivables. These loans can be further collateralized by a lien pledged on the installed systems, on the property itself, or both. A is incorrect as solar loans are typically extended only to prime borrowers who own their homes and have good payment records. C is incorrect as the loans enable property owner purchase of installed systems instead of rental that is transacted through solar leases.",

Moreover, these residual tranche investors play a key role in whether a CLO is viable or not; the CLO structure has to offer competitive returns for this tranche. Facing these risk/return possibilities puts them in the position of the marginal, price-setting investors. A and C are incorrect because they are promised fixed returns without reference to the underlying performance of the collateral pool.

After the ramp-up period but before underlying collateral pool loans mature, the collateral manager may replace loans in the portfolio as long as the new asset meets the portfolio selection criteria. A is incorrect because while additional assets are added to the collateral pool during a subsequent ramp-up period, loan replacements can still occur after the ramp-up period.

      "explanation": "Solution The correct answer is B. A complicating factor of a default can be the call features embedded in bonds. While exercising call options on debt would replenish the collateral pool, distributing these proceeds to the senior and mezzanine tranches would shrink the size of the collateral pool, further narrowing the earnings potential with junior tranches receiving the least cash flow. A is incorrect because senior tranches are then in danger of not receiving some or any payments, depending on the size of the default. C is incorrect because losses would first be absorbed by junior tranche investors, with remaining losses realized by the other tranches in order of repayment seniority.",

A CDO is a leveraged transaction, where equity tranche holders use borrowed funds (i.e., the bond classes issued) to generate a return above the funding cost.
