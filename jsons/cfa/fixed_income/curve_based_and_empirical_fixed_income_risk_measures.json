      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because this response uses 1% for the change in the benchmark yield curve (ΔCurve), instead of 0.5%. Effective duration = (PV – – PV + )/(2 × ΔCurve × PV 0 ) = ($198 million – $174 million)/(2 × 0.01 × $186 million) = 6.4516 ≈ 6.5. Correct because effective duration = (PV – – PV + )/(2 × ΔCurve × PV 0 ) = ($198 million – $174 million)/(2 × 0.005 × $186 million) = 12.9032 ≈ 12.9. Incorrect because this response uses an incorrect formula for effective duration; (PV – – PV + )/(ΔCurve × PV 0 ) = ($198 million – $174 million)/(0.005 × $186 million) = 25.8065 ≈ 25.8. Curve-Based and Empirical Fixed-Income Risk Measures explain why effective duration and effective convexity are the most appropriate measures of interest rate risk for bonds with embedded options",
