        "A": "The bank receives commercial paper when the ABCP is issued.",

A is incorrect because the bank receives cash when the ABCP is issued, which increases the bank’s return.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Solution B is correct. Committed lines require more bank capital than uncommitted lines, although commitments of less than a year (usually 364 days) minimize a bank’s capital requirement. A is incorrect because Sycamore will receive an upfront commitment fee on a committed line of credit.

      "question": "<div><div><div>\n<p>Assume that today (<em>t</em> = 0) the current US five-year Treasury note trades at a price equal to the bond’s face value of USD50,000,000. The security buyer takes delivery of the US Treasury note today and pays the security seller USD50,000,000. Assume a repo term of 45 days (and 360 days in a year) and a repo rate of 0.375%. If the buyer agrees to return the five-year Treasury note 45 days from today (<em>t</em> = <em>T</em>) to the seller, the repurchase price is <em>closest</em> to:</p>\n</div></div></div>",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Solution B is correct. USD50,023,438 is calculated as: USD50,000,000 × [1 + (0.375% × 45/360)] = USD50,023,438. In effect, the security seller borrows USD50,000,000 on a short-term basis at a low cost, with interest (USD23,438) paid at maturity, because the loan is collateralized by the US Treasury note. A is incorrect because a repo term of 30 days, as opposed to 45 days, is incorrectly used: USD50,000,000 × [1 + (0.375% × 30/360)] = USD50,015,625. C is incorrect because the repo term and number of days in a year are not used: USD50,000,000 × (1 + 0.375%) = USD50,187,500.",
