      "explanation": "Solution C is correct. Sovereign government issuers typically have the lowest credit risk (highest credit rating) in each market, due to sovereign governments’ right to tax economic activity. High-yield issuers have below-investment-grade credit ratings (BBB- or below), while distressed issuers typically have high-yield ratings or are in default.",

      "explanation": "Solution A is correct. Increasing the size of an existing bond with a price significantly different from par is referred to as the reopening of an existing bond. A private placement refers to bonds being sold to a selected investor or group of investors, versus a sale to the public. Bonds of issuers believed to be very close to or in bankruptcy are referred to as distressed.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Solution B is correct. Bonds of less frequent corporate issuers or more seasoned bonds of frequent issuers are rarely traded, leading dealers to quote bid–offer spreads of at least 10–20 basis points or more for small sizes. The most recently issued, or on-the-run, developed market sovereign bonds are typically the most liquid fixed-income securities, with primary dealers making active markets in large size with bid–offer spreads equal to a fraction of a basis point. Among corporate issuers, recently issued corporate bonds from frequent issuers of higher credit quality usually exhibit the greatest liquidity and tightest bid–offer spreads.",
