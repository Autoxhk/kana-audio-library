The incorrect realized horizon yield of 2.31% is calculated as follows: The future value of coupons assuming no reinvestment (0% return) is 12.0000: 12.0000 = [4 × (1 + 0.0000) 2 ] + [4 × (1 + 0.0000) 1 ] + 4.

The total return is 112.0000 (= 12.0000 + 100.0000), resulting in a realized three-year horizon yield of 2.31%: 104.58 = 112.0000 ( 1 + 𝑟 ) 3 , 𝑟 = 0.0231 104.58 = 112.0000 ( 1 + r ) 3 , r = 0.0231 . Correct. The investor’s three-year horizon yield is 3.41%, based on the total of the reinvested coupon payments during the holding period and the sale price of the bond, calculated as follows: The future value of reinvested coupons for three years at 2.25% is 12.2720: 12.2720 = [4 × (1 + 0.0225) 2 ] + [4 × (1 + 0.0225) 1 ] + 4. At the end of the third year, the sale price of the bond is 103.3853: 103.3853 = 4 ( 1 + 0.0225 ) 1 + 104 ( 1 + 0.0225 ) 2 103.3853 = 4 ( 1 + 0.0225 ) 1 + 104 ( 1 + 0.0225 ) 2 . So, the total return is 115.6573 (= 12.2720 + 103.3853), resulting in a realized three-year horizon yield of 3.41%: 104.58 = 115.6573 ( 1 + 𝑟 ) 3 , 𝑟 = 0.0341 104.58 = 115.6573 ( 1 + r ) 3 , r = 0.0341 .

When interest rates go up (down), the future value of reinvested coupons increases (decreases) whereas the sale price of a bond that matures after the horizon date decreases (increases). Incorrect because investors holding the same bond can have very different exposures to interest rate risk if they have different investment horizons. When the investor’s horizon is short relative to a bond’s time to maturity, market price risk matters more than coupon reinvestment risk. In contrast, when the investor’s horizon is long, reinvestment risk matters more than market price risk. Correct.

Interest Rate Risk and Return calculate and interpret the sources of return from investing in a fixed-rate bond;",
      "solution_html": "<div><h4>Solution</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Incorrect because coupon reinvestment risk and market price risk are offsetting types of interest rate risk that are inversely (not positively) related. When interest rates go up (down), the future value of reinvested coupons increases (decreases) whereas the sale price of a bond that matures after the horizon date decreases (increases).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Incorrect because investors holding the same bond can have very different exposures to interest rate risk if they have different investment horizons. When the investor’s horizon is short relative to a bond’s time to maturity, market price risk matters more than coupon reinvestment risk. In contrast, when the investor’s horizon is long, reinvestment risk matters more than market price risk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Correct.</strong> Market price risk matters more than coupon reinvestment risk when the investor has a short horizon relative to the bond’s time to maturity.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Interest Rate Risk and Return</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>calculate and interpret the sources of return from investing in a fixed-rate bond;</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Solution A is correct. Hightest Capital’s investment horizon is four years, which is less than the bond’s Macaulay duration of 5.86 years. Therefore, price risk dominates reinvestment risk and Hightest Capital faces price risk from rising interest rates. B is incorrect because the increase in interest rates is beneficial for coupon reinvestment. Therefore, Hightest Capital has positive reinvestment risk. C is incorrect because Hightest Capital faces the risk that the price of the bond will fall as a result of the 50 bp increase in interest rates and therefore has negative price risk.",
