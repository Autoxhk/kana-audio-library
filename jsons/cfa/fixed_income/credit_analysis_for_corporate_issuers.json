      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because as a general rule, the higher the senior unsecured rating, the smaller the notching adjustment. Incorrect because notching is applied according to each credit rating agency's notching guidelines. Correct because recognizing different payment priorities, and thus the potential for higher (or lower) loss severity in the event of default, the rating agencies have adopted a notching process whereby their credit ratings on issues can be moved up or down from the issuer rating, which is usually the rating applied to its senior unsecured debt. As a general rule, the higher the senior unsecured rating, the smaller the notching adjustment. The reason behind this is that the higher the rating, the lower the perceived risk of default; so, the need to 'notch' the rating to capture the potential difference in loss severity is greatly reduced. For lower-rated credits, however, the risk of default is greater and thus the potential difference in loss from a lower (or higher) priority ranking is a bigger consideration in assessing an issue’s credit riskiness.

      "solution_html": "<div><h4>Solution</h4>\n<p><strong>The correct answer is B.</strong> Senior unsecured bonds issued by the holding company are said to be structurally subordinated to those issued by the major operating subsidiary. Debt at the operating subsidiary will be serviced by the cash flow and assets of the subsidiary first before any funds can be upstreamed to the holding company to service debt at that level.</p>\n<p>Since the operating subsidiary accounts for over 90% of the group’s cash flow and assets but only half of the group’s senior unsecured debt, the holding company debt can only be serviced after the operating subsidiary debt is paid in full. The unsecured bonds issued by the subsidiary will most likely have higher recovery.</p></div>",
