      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Solution Correct. Credit spreads narrow during economic expansions and widen during economic contractions. During an economic expansion, corporate revenues and cash flows rise, making it easier for corporations to service their debt, and investors purchase corporates instead of Treasuries, causing spreads to narrow. Incorrect. Credit spreads narrow during economic expansions and widen during economic contractions. Incorrect. During a flight to quality investors sell corporate and buy treasuries thereby widening the credit spread on corporates. Credit Risk describe macroeconomic, market, and issuer-specific factors that influence the level and volatility of yield spreads",

We can compare Bond 1 and Bond 2 by calculating the expected loss for each and comparing it to the annual spread: EL = POD × LGD Credit Spread ≈ POD × LGD Bond 1: EL = 0.938% (= 1.25% × 75%) Spread − EL = 6.2 bps (= 1.00% − 0.938%). Bond 2: EL = 0.935% (= 1.1% × 85%) Spread − EL = 1.5 bps (=0.95% − 0.935%). An investor should therefore choose Bond 1 given its higher expected return versus credit risk. A is incorrect as it fails to take the LGD into account. B is incorrect as although Bond 1 earns a 1.5 bps spread above the expected annual loss, it is less than the additional 6.2 bps spread above the expected loss earned by purchasing Bond 1.",
