A lack of property buyers in the market will make it challenging for a borrower to sell a property to generate sufficient funds to pay off the outstanding principal balance. A is incorrect because a high DSCR would reduce the balloon risk. B is incorrect because a low LTV ratio would also reduce the balloon risk of a maturing loan.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Solution The correct answer is C. Structural call protection is achieved through sequential-pay tranches in the CMBS as a lower-rated tranche cannot be paid down until the higher-rated tranche is completely retired. A is incorrect because defeasance provides call protection at the individual loan level. Defeasance allows prepayment, but the borrower must purchase a portfolio of government securities that fully replicates the cash flows of the remaining scheduled principal and interest payments, including the balloon loan balance, on the loan. B is incorrect because prepayment lockout provides call protection at the individual loan level. Prepayment lockout is a contractual agreement that prohibits any prepayments during a specified period.",
