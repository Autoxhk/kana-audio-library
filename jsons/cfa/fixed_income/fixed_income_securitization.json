      "explanation": "Solution The correct answer is C. Securitization provides a direct conduit between borrowers and investors. It also allows investors to tailor interest rate and credit risk exposures to suit their specific risk, return, and maturity needs. A is incorrect because securitization creates efficiency for issuers and financial markets more directly than for investors. Securitization allows issuers to sell illiquid assets and operate more efficiently on a risk-adjusted basis. Moreover, because securitization creates tradable securities with higher liquidity than the original underlying assets, it makes financial markets more efficient. B is incorrect because securitization improves overall liquidity in the financial system and reduces liquidity risk, which benefits participants in financial markets.",

      "explanation": "Solution The correct answer is B. In order for these assets (leases) to be securitized, they must be held in a separate legal entity structure distinct from AR&C. The separate legal entity structure ensures that if AR&C, the originator of the leases, files for bankruptcy, the leases backing the ABS that are issued by the separate legal entity are secure there, thus AR&C’s creditors cannot have any claim on them. A is incorrect because if AR&C issues the securities, the leases remain on AR&C’s balance sheet and thus could still be accessible to AR&C’s creditors in the event of a bankruptcy. C is incorrect because servicing the leases must continue whether or not by AR&C or another entity, but servicing the leases is separate from securitizing them.",

      "question": "<div><div><p>A BBB rated corporation wishes to issue debt to finance its operations at the lowest cost possible. If it decides to sell a pool of receivables into a special purpose entity (SPE), its primary motivation is <em>most likely</em> to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>allow the corporation to retain a first lien on the assets of the SPE.</li>\n<li>segregate the assets into a bankruptcy-remote entity for bondholders.</li>\n<li>receive a guaranty from the SPE to improve the corporation’s credit rating.</li>\n</ol>\n</div></div>",
      "choices": {},
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because the corporation does not retain a lien on those assets. The seller of the collateral sells the collateral to the SPE. Besides the standard bond indenture and its covenants, two additional legal documents play an important role in the securitization process. One is the purchase agreement between the seller of the collateral (the original lender) and the SPE, which outlines the representations and warranties that the seller makes about the assets sold. Correct because in a securitization, the courts in most jurisdictions have no discretion to change seniority because the bankruptcy of the originating company does not affect the SPE. Hence removing assets from the balance sheet into an SPE is an important decoupling of the credit risk of the entity needing funds from the SPE and the bond classes issued by it. This explains why the SPE is structured as a bankruptcy-remote entity. Incorrect because the SPE does not receive a guaranty. The seller of the collateral sells the collateral to the SPE.
