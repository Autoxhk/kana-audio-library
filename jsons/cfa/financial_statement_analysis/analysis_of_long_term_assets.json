Under IFRS, the carrying amount (132) is compared to the higher of fair value minus costs to sell (104 =105 – 1) and present value of expected future cash flows (100). The higher of the two amounts, the recoverable amount is 104; therefore, the asset is impaired and written down to that amount. The impairment loss = 132 – 104 = 28.

The increase in the asset’s carrying amount bypasses the income statement and is reported as other comprehensive income and appears in equity under the heading of revaluation surplus. Therefore, shareholders’ equity will increase but net income will not be affected, so return on equity will decline. Return on assets and debt to capital ratios will also decrease.",
