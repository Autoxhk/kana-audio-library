      "choices": {},
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Solution Correct as U.S. GAAP prohibit the reversal of write-downs. Incorrect because this is the reversal under IFRS. Inventories shall be measured (and carried on the balance sheet) at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Reversal (limited to the amount of the original write-down) is required for a subsequent increase in value of inventory previously written down. The reversal of any write-down of inventories is recognized as a reduction in cost of sales (reduction in the amount of inventories recognized as an expense). The write-down in Year 1 is equal to €5 million (€65 cost − €60 net realizable value). The subsequent reversal is limited to the original €5 million write-down. Under U.S. GAAP, reversal of a write-down is prohibited. Incorrect and is the amount of the reversal allowed if the candidate incorrectly calculated the initial write-down as €7 million (€65 cost − €58 current replacement cost) under IFRS. This is also the correct initial write-down under U.S. GAAP, assuming inventories are measured using LIFO or retail inventory methods. Also, it is the amount by which the net realizable value exceeds carrying value at 31 December Year 2. However, under U.S. GAAP, reversal of a write-down is prohibited.

In addition, taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized. As the asset carrying amount is less than the tax base, it will result in a deferred tax asset.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Solution Correct because when a company disposes of or establishes a plan to dispose of one of its component operations and will have no further involvement in the operation, the income statement reports separately the effect of this disposal as a “discontinued” operation under both IFRS and US GAAP. Financial standards provide various criteria for reporting the effect separately, which are generally that the discontinued component must be separable both physically and operationally. Incorrect because IFRS require that items of income or expense that are material and/or relevant to the understanding of the entity’s financial performance should be disclosed separately. Unusual or infrequent items are likely to meet these criteria. For example, restructuring charges, such as costs to close plants and employee termination costs, are considered part of a company’s ordinary activities. As another example, gains and losses arising when a company sells an asset or part of a business, for more or less than its carrying value, are also disclosed separately on the income statement. These sales are considered ordinary business activities. Incorrect because both IFRS and US GAAP specify that the results of discontinued operations should be reported separately from continuing operations.

Incorrect because changing the depreciation method from straight-line to double-declining balance is an example of a conservative accounting policy change.

Another example of how choices and estimates can affect reported results lies in the selection of a depreciation method for allocating the cost of long-lived assets to accounting periods subsequent to their acquisition. A company’s managers may choose to depreciate long-lived assets (1) on a straight-line basis, with each year bearing the same amount of depreciation expense; (2) using an accelerated method, with greater depreciation expense recognition in the earlier part of an asset’s life; or (3) using an activity-based depreciation method, which allocates depreciation expense based on units of use or production. Incorrect because changing from weighted average to FIFO inventory valuation method in a period of declining inventory prices and quantities is an example of a conservative accounting policy change.

Since the firm has interest bearing debt outstanding, $18,000 ($30,000 × (1 − .4)) is added back to CFO in calculating FCFF. In addition, the capital expenditures of $82,000 are subtracted so the equation becomes CFO + $18,000 − $82,000 for a net decrease to CFO of $64,000 ($18,000 − $82,000 = − $64,000). The calculation for free cash flow to equity is CFO – capital expenditures + net borrowing with no adjustment for interest paid under U.S. GAAP.

A higher interest coverage ratio indicates stronger solvency, offering greater assurance that the company can service its debt from operating earnings. Accordingly, Interest coverage ratio = EBIT/Interest payment. Year 1 Interest coverage ratio = 40/8 = 5 and Year 2 Interest coverage ratio = 35/5 = 7. Therefore, interest coverage ratio has increased which indicates stronger solvency.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Financial Analysis Techniques</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>calculate and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, and profitability ratios</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because it has not weighted the number of shares outstanding during the year, and has instead applied the period-end balance along with the effect of the conversion. That is, weighted average number of shares outstanding is mistakenly calculated as 1,100,000 shares plus 200,000 which equals 1,300,000. Assuming all else equal, $1,312,000 / 1,300,000 = $1.01. Correct because the basic EPS calculation highlights that the convertible bond is dilutive; that is, Basic EPS = (Net income – Preferred dividends) / (Weighted average number of shares outstanding), Where net income is $1,200,000. There are no preferred dividends. Weighted average number of shares outstanding is: 1,000,000 × (3 months ÷ 12 months) = 250,000 1,100,000 × (9 months ÷ 12 months) = 825,000 Weighted average number of shares outstanding equals 250,000 + 825,000 = 1,075,000 shares. Basic EPS = $1,200,000 / 1,075,000 = $1.12. Diluted EPS is calculated using the following formula: (Net income + After-tax interest on convertible debt – Preferred dividends) / (Weighted average number of shares outstanding + Additional common shares that would have been issued at conversion) After-tax interest on convertible debt equals $2,000,000 × 8% × (1 – 30%) = $112,000. Therefore, computed diluted EPS = ($1,200,000 + $112,000) / (1,075,000 + 200,000) = $1,312,000 / 1,275,000 = $1.029 which rounds to $1.03. Incorrect because the pre-tax cost of debt has been added back to net income. That is, $2,000,0000 × 8% = $160,000, therefore applying net income of $1,200,000 plus $160,000 = $1,360,000. Assuming all else equal: $1,360,000 / 1,275,000 = $1.067 which rounds to $1.07.

Correct because in recognizing the impairment loss in Year 1, carrying cost was reduced from €50,000 to €40,000, so an impairment loss of $10,000 was reported. A reversal can only be taken for the previous carrying amount; not the full recoverable amount. Therefore with the reversal, carrying cost returns to its previous level of €50,000.

Thus, average tax rate = 1 – Tax burden = 1 – 53.48% = 46.52% ≈ 47. Correct because using DuPont analysis, ROE = Tax Burden × Interest Burden × EBIT margin × Total asset turnover × Leverage. Accordingly, Tax burden = ROE / (Interest Burden × EBIT margin × Total asset turnover × Leverage) = 15% / (0.85 × 30% × 1.1 × 1.25) = 42.78%. Tax burden reflects one minus the average tax rate, or how much of a company’s pretax profits it gets to keep. Thus, average tax rate = 1 – Tax burden = 1 – 42.78% = 57.22% ≈ 57%.

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because this is a profitability ratio and ROE measures the return earned by a company on its equity capital, including minority equity, preferred equity, and common equity. ROE = Net income / Average total equity Incorrect because this is an activity ratio (or asset utilization ratio or operating efficiency ratio), which measures how well a company manages various activities. Fixed asset turnover = Revenue / Average net fixed assets. The fixed assets turnover ratio measures how efficiently the company generates revenues from its investments in fixed assets. Correct because solvency ratios are primarily of two types. Debt ratios, the first type, focus on the balance sheet and measure the amount of debt capital relative to equity capital. Coverage ratios, the second type, focus on the income statement and measure the ability of a company to cover its debt payments. These ratios are useful in assessing a company’s solvency and, therefore, in evaluating the quality of a company’s bonds and other debt obligations. Fixed charge coverage ratio = (EBIT + Lease payments) / (Interest payments + lease payments). A higher fixed charge coverage ratio implies stronger solvency, offering greater assurance that the company can service its debt (i.e., bank debt, bonds, notes, and leases) from normal earnings.

Accordingly, Fixed charge coverage ratio = (Net income + Lease payments) / (Interest payments + Lease payments) = (8 + 4) / (6 + 4) = 1.2. Incorrect because it omits Lease payments in the numerator. Accordingly, Fixed charge coverage ratio = EBIT / (Interest payments + Lease payments) = 16 / (6 + 4) = 1.6. Correct because the fixed charge coverage ratio relates fixed financing charges, or obligations, to the cash flow generated by the company. It measures the number of times a company’s earnings (before interest, taxes, and lease payments) can cover the company’s interest and lease payments. Accordingly, Fixed charge coverage ratio = (EBIT + Lease payments) / (Interest payments + Lease payments) = (16 + 4) / (6 + 4) = 2.0. For computing this ratio, an assumption sometimes made is that one-third of the lease payment amount represents interest on the lease obligation and that the rest is a repayment of principal on the obligation. For this variant of the fixed charge coverage ratio, the numerator is EBIT plus one-third of lease payments and the denominator is interest payments plus one-third of lease payments. Accordingly, Fixed charge coverage ratio = [EBIT + (Lease payments / 3)] / (Interest payments + (Lease payments / 3)) = (16 + 4/3) / (6 + 4/3) ≈ 2.36 which is also closest to 2.0.
