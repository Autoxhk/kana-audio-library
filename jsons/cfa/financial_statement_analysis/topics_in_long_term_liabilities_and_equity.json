Lessor accounting for an operating lease under US GAAP is similar to that under IFRS: Over the lease term, the lessor recognizes lease receipts as income and recognizes related costs, including depreciation of the leased asset, as expenses. Under IFRS, at inception of a finance lease—not an operating lease—the lessor derecognizes the underlying leased asset and recognizes a lease asset comprising the lease receivable and relevant residual value. Further, an IFRS-reporting lessor will recognize selling profit at the beginning of all leases that are not classified as operating leases. In contrast, a US GAAP–reporting lessor will recognize selling profit only on sales-type leases at the beginning of the lease term.",
