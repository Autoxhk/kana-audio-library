      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect. Preferred dividends were included after preferred conversion. Basic EPS Diluted EPS: Bond Converted Diluted EPS: Preferred Converted Diluted EPS: Both Converted Net income $1,000,000 $1,000,000 $1,000,000 $1,000,000 Preferred dividends –$20,000 –$20,000 0 0 After-tax cost of interest 8% × $80,000 × (1 – 0.40) --- $3,840 --- $3,840 Numerator $980,000 $983,840 $1,000,000 $1,003,840 Average common shares outstanding 100,000 100,000 100,000 100,000 Preferred converted --- --- 10,000 10,000 Bond converted --- 20,000 --- 20,000 Denominator 100,000 120,000 110,000 130,000 EPS $9.80 $8.20 $9.09 $7.72 Incorrect. After-tax interest on bonds was not added back after bond conversion: after-tax interest is (1 – 0.40) × 8% × $80,000 = 3,840. Basic EPS Diluted EPS: Bond Converted Diluted EPS: Preferred Converted Diluted EPS: Both Converted Net income $1,000,000 $1,000,000 $1,000,000 $1,000,000 Preferred dividends –$20,000 –$20,000 0 0 After-tax cost of interest 8% × $80,000 × (1 – 0.40) --- $3,840 --- $3,840 Numerator $980,000 $983,840 $1,000,000 $1,003,840 Average common shares outstanding 100,000 100,000 100,000 100,000 Preferred converted --- --- 10,000 10,000 Bond converted --- 20,000 --- 20,000 Denominator 100,000 120,000 110,000 130,000 EPS $9.80 $8.20 $9.09 $7.72 Correct. Because both the preferred shares and the bonds are dilutive, they should both be converted to calculate the diluted EPS. Diluted EPS is the lowest possible value. Basic EPS Diluted EPS: Bond Converted Diluted EPS: Preferred Converted Diluted EPS: Both Converted Net income $1,000,000 $1,000,000 $1,000,000 $1,000,000 Preferred dividends –$20,000 –$20,000 0 0 After-tax cost of interest 8% × $80,000 × (1 – 0.40) --- $3,840 --- $3,840 Numerator $980,000 $983,840 $1,000,000 $1,003,840 Average common shares outstanding 100,000 100,000 100,000 100,000 Preferred converted --- --- 10,000 10,000 Bond converted 20,000 --- 20,000 Denominator 100,000 120,000 110,000 130,000 EPS $9.80 $8.20 $9.09 $7.72 Analyzing Income Statements describe how earnings per share is calculated and calculate and interpret a company’s basic and diluted earnings per share for companies with simple and complex capital structures including those with antidilutive securities",

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because the conversion of the preferred shares into common stock for determining diluted EPS is miscalculated: Basic EPS = Net income − Perferred dividends Weighted average number of shares outstanding = $ 100 million − [ 10 million perferred shares × $ 1 . 00 perferred dividend per share ] 25 million = $ 100 − $ 10 25 = $ 3 . 60 Basic EPS = Net income - Perferred dividends Weighted average number of shares outstanding = $ 100 million - 10 million perferred shares × $ 1 . 00 perferred dividend per share 25 million = $ 100 - $ 10 25 = $ 3 . 60 Diluted EPS = Net income Weighted average number of shares outstanding + New common shares that would have been issued at conversion = $ 100 million 25 million + 10 million = $ 2 . 86 Diluted EPS = Net income Weighted average number of shares outstanding + New common shares that would have been issued at conversion = $ 100 million 25 million + 10 million = $ 2 . 86 Net difference = $3.60 – $2.86 = $0.74 The correct number of new shares for the preferred stock conversion in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation is 5 million (each preferred share is convertible into 0.5 common shares), not 10 million shares. Correct. As the calculations below show, the basic and diluted EPS are $3.60 and $3.33, respectively, and the resulting net difference is $0.27.

As a result, the conversion of stock options increases the number of common shares outstanding but has no effect on net income available to common shareholders. The conversion of convertible debt increases the net income available to common shareholders by the after-tax amount of interest expense saved.

Common-size income statements facilitate comparison across time periods (time-series analysis) because the standardization of each line item removes the effect of size. They would be particularly useful in neutralizing the size effect for a company experiencing rapid growth. For example, efficiencies gained from increased volume may be more readily apparent. Common-size income statements would be less useful for similarly sized companies from different industries because the size effect is less important in the comparison. Incorrect. Common-size income statements eliminate the effect of size, so they would be less useful in a comparison of similarly-sized companies.

      "choices": {},

      "explanation": "Solution Incorrect because the effective tax rate did not average 2% over the period. In the case of taxes, it is more meaningful to compare the amount of taxes paid with the amount of pre-tax income, then examine the causes for any differences in effective tax rates. Although taxes as a percent of sales has held steady at roughly 2%, OA’s corporate tax rate exceeded 20% each year.

OA’s cost of sales have been steadily rising, causing the firm’s gross profit margin to fall below the industry average. A falling gross margin indicates falling revenue per dollar of sales costs. Incorrect because OA’s industry-relative performance shows below-average gross margin results, in contrast to the net profit margin, which exceeds the industry average.
